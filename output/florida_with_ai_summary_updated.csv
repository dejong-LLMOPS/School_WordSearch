"I cannot provide the comprehensive analysis you've requested because the search results provided do not contain specific content from Challenge at Alachua Academy's website or materials.

The search results include general information about restorative justice practices in Florida's juvenile justice system and Alachua County schools, but they do not contain the actual scraped content from Challenge at Alachua Academy's 67-page website that you reference in your query. While the URLs you listed point to Florida Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) pages, the search results show only generic DJJ website navigation and boilerplate content—not substantive information about Challenge at Alachua Academy's specific approach, philosophy, infrastructure, or programs.

To complete this analysis accurately, I would need:

- Direct excerpts from Challenge at Alachua Academy's website pages that specifically discuss restorative justice, restorative practices, or race equity
- Specific program descriptions, mission statements, or policy documents from the school
- Staff position titles and descriptions related to these initiatives
- Details about how these terms are contextualized within the school's educational approach

**What the current search results do show** is that restorative justice and restorative practices are being implemented across Alachua County schools more broadly[1][3], and that the River Phoenix Center for Peacebuilding has trained educators from multiple schools in the county on these approaches[1]. However, this does not constitute evidence of Challenge at Alachua Academy's specific implementation or philosophy.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not part of IDEA Victory / IDEA Public Schools' approach, as the term appears only once in the scraped content from the IDEA Rundberg campus page without any description, implementation details, or integration into school practices.

The term ""restorative justice"" is mentioned solely on the IDEA Rundberg page (https://ideapublicschools.org/our-schools/idea-rundberg/), a campus-specific section under IDEA Public Schools that details the school's founding year (2015), enrollment (1478 students in K-12), location (9504 North Interstate 35 Frontage Road, Austin, TX 78753), and various accountability reports, such as 2025 Campus Federal Report Cards for IDEA Rundberg Academy and College Prep, Campus Improvement Plans from 2022-2024, and School Report Cards. However, the provided content snippet cuts off abruptly after introducing Principal Jimena Giner's bio, with no surrounding context, examples, or explanation for the term's inclusion—appearing instead amid logistical details like quicklinks to curriculum, admissions, academic calendars, and campus leaders. It is not referenced in official policies, program descriptions, mission statements, staff listings, or any structured educational framework; rather, it stands as a passing, isolated mention without elaboration.

No evidence indicates that Restorative Justice forms part of the school's philosophy. The page emphasizes **high expectations for every student**, **personalized learning**, **critical thinking skills**, and **mastery of core subjects** as the ""recipe for success,"" with no connection to restorative practices, relationship-building through dialogue, harm repair, or alternatives to punitive discipline. The term's peripheral placement suggests it is not conceptualized or integrated into their educational approach, lacking any definition, goals, or alignment with the school's stated priorities.

No infrastructure supports Restorative Justice. The content identifies no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs, centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative practices; campus leadership is limited to figures like Principal Jimena Giner of IDEA Rundberg Academy, whose bio focuses on her teaching and administrative experience without restorative references. Accountability documents and improvement plans are listed but do not mention such elements.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not part of IDEA Bassett / IDEA Public Schools' approach based on the available content from the school website. The term ""restorative justice"" appears once on the IDEA Rundberg page (noted as relevant to IDEA Bassett), but the provided scraped content cuts off abruptly without any surrounding context, description, policy reference, or explanation of its use, making it impossible to confirm integration into their practices.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: The term ""restorative justice"" is flagged as found exclusively on one page—the IDEA Rundberg campus page at https://ideapublicschools.org/our-schools/idea-rundberg/—with no occurrences on district-wide pages. In the scraped content, it appears amid general campus details like founding year (2015), enrollment (1478 students, K-12), location (9504 North Interstate 35 Frontage Road, Austin, TX), accountability reports, improvement plans, quicklinks to curriculum and admissions, and staff bios (e.g., Principal Jimena Giner), but the text truncates mid-sentence in her bio without linking the term to any specific section such as mission statements, discipline policies, or program descriptions. This isolated mention lacks elaboration, suggesting it may be a passing reference rather than a defined element of official policies or initiatives.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: The content provides no evidence that Restorative Justice forms part of the school's philosophy or is integrated into their educational approach. IDEA Rundberg emphasizes **high expectations**, **personalized learning**, **critical thinking**, and **mastery of core subjects** as its ""recipe for success,"" with no connection drawn to restorative concepts like harm repair, relationship building, or alternatives to punitive discipline. Without contextual usage, the term's meaning to the school remains undefined and peripheral at best.[1]

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure related to Restorative Justice is evident, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., restorative centers or circles), training initiatives, or organizational structures. Campus leaders like Principal Jimena Giner are mentioned for operational roles, but none tie to restorative practices. The absence of details confirms a lack of visible implementation support.[1]

"Based on the available content from IDEA Public Schools' website, **restorative justice is not clearly established as part of the school or district's documented approach**. While the term ""restorative justice"" appears in the search results provided to me, the actual content from the IDEA Rundberg campus page—the only IDEA Public Schools page where the term was reportedly found—does not contain substantive information about restorative justice practices, philosophy, or implementation.

The scraped content from the IDEA Rundberg webpage focuses primarily on institutional information: campus location, enrollment figures, grade levels served, accountability reports, campus improvement plans, federal report cards, and leadership biographies. The page emphasizes the school's commitment to ""high expectations for every student"" and highlights ""personalized learning, critical thinking skills, mastery of core subjects"" as their recipe for success. However, there is no explicit discussion of restorative justice as a disciplinary philosophy, conflict resolution approach, or core educational practice within this material.

Regarding contextual placement, the term ""restorative justice"" does not appear in the excerpted content provided from the IDEA Rundberg page. The content suggests that if the term exists on this page, it may be present in sections not included in the scraped material, or it may appear in a context that does not receive prominent emphasis in the school's public-facing materials.

Without access to complete page content or additional district-level documentation that explicitly addresses restorative justice frameworks, discipline policies, or related practices, it is not possible to determine whether restorative justice is integrated into IDEA Public Schools' educational philosophy or infrastructure. No dedicated staff positions, specialized programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative justice are evident in the available content.

**Contextual Understanding**: The phrase ""restorative justice"" is identified as a ""key term found"" on the single page https://ideapublicschools.org/our-schools/idea-rundberg/, which serves as the main campus overview for IDEA Rundberg in Austin, Texas. However, the provided content snippet—a detailed page covering campus history (founded 2015, serving 1,478 K-12 students), location (9504 North Interstate 35 Frontage Road), leadership (e.g., Principal Jimena Giner of IDEA Rundberg Academy), accountability reports, quicklinks to curriculum and admissions, and federal report cards—contains no visible occurrence or contextual usage of the term. It appears as a passing or metadata-level mention without embedding in official policies, program descriptions, staff bios, mission statements, or any disciplinary context, such as alongside topics like personalized learning, critical thinking, or campus improvement plans.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: No evidence indicates that restorative justice is part of the school's philosophy or integrated into its educational approach. The campus emphasizes high expectations, personalized learning, mastery of core subjects, and student potential, but restorative justice is not conceptualized, defined, or linked to these elements. It remains peripheral at best, with no elaboration on its meaning or role within IDEA Rundberg's high-achieving, college-preparatory model.[1]

**Infrastructure**: The content reveals no dedicated infrastructure for restorative justice, including staff positions (e.g., no coordinators, facilitators, or specialists mentioned), programs, centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures. Leadership details focus on principals like Jimena Giner without referencing restorative roles, and quicklinks cover academics, nutrition, and transportation but omit discipline-related programs.[1]

"Based on the available content from Charlotte County Public Schools' district website, **restorative practices are part of the district's approach to student discipline and mental health support**, though the specific implementation details at Peace River Elementary School cannot be determined from the provided materials.

## Restorative Justice Presence

Restorative practices appear in Charlotte County Public Schools' official materials and policies. The district's Code of Student Conduct explicitly states that ""Schools are encouraged to use Restorative Justice practices when appropriate.""[8] Additionally, the district has approved curriculum materials that include restorative practices components. Specifically, Navigate 360 Mental Health & Prevention and Intervention & Restorative Practices Student Materials were approved by the CCPS school board on March 7, 2023, for use with students.[7]

## Contextual Understanding

The term ""restorative practices"" appears on the district's School-Based Mental Health Materials page, which is maintained by the Division of School Support.[7] This page documents newly purchased materials and contracts that have undergone public review and board approval in accordance with HB 1467: K-12 Education. The reference to restorative practices is not peripheral but rather appears as part of an officially approved curriculum resource (Navigate 360), indicating institutional commitment to these approaches. The district's Code of Student Conduct also incorporates restorative justice language within its disciplinary framework.[8]

## Philosophy Assessment

The district's inclusion of restorative practices in approved curriculum materials and explicit encouragement of their use in school discipline policies suggests that restorative practices are integrated into the district's broader educational philosophy, particularly regarding student conduct and mental health support. The district appears to conceptualize restorative practices as an alternative or complement to traditional exclusionary discipline, aligning with the broader educational movement toward relationship-focused, harm-repair approaches.[6][8]

## Infrastructure

The available content does not provide specific information about dedicated staff positions, program centers, or organizational structures at Peace River Elementary School or district-wide that are specifically designated for restorative practices implementation. However, the district maintains a Division of School Support that reviews and approves mental health and character education materials, including those related to restorative practices.[7] The district's approval of Navigate 360 materials suggests some level of infrastructure exists to support implementation, though specific details are not available in the provided content.

No references appear on the East Elementary School website or other district pages scraped, and the term is not tied to official policies, mission statements, staff listings, or program descriptions beyond this approval list[8].

Content does not indicate that restorative practices form a central part of the district's philosophy or are deeply integrated into the educational approach; rather, it represents a peripheral endorsement as one element among several approved mental health tools, such as AIM Curriculum, Leader in Me, and Studies Weekly. The district conceptualizes it as student-facing materials within a broader mental health and prevention framework under the Division of School Support, with no elaboration on its meaning, implementation, or connection to discipline[8][9]. Existing materials reviewed by school-based mental health staff are tracked in a spreadsheet, but restorative practices are not highlighted as foundational or proactive[8].

No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or restorative justice.

The page also references a spreadsheet of existing materials reviewed by school-based mental health staff, but restorative practices are highlighted only among the newly approved items, not as part of broader policies, mission statements, or staff descriptions.[7]

This inclusion suggests restorative practices form a peripheral element of CCPS's educational philosophy, integrated into their mental health and character education framework rather than a core, district-wide discipline strategy. The district conceptualizes it as a component of approved student materials within the Navigate 360 suite, likely emphasizing prevention, intervention, and relationship-building alongside mental health supports, but no further elaboration on its meaning, implementation, or connection to restorative justice principles—like harm repair or community circles—is provided. It aligns with their broader goal of compliance-driven student success but does not indicate deep philosophical embedding.[7]

Content does not indicate that restorative practices form a core part of the district's philosophy; instead, it represents a peripheral, approved component of mental health curricula rather than an integrated educational or disciplinary framework.[7] The district conceptualizes these practices as student-facing materials within a Navigate 360 program focused on mental health prevention and intervention, suggesting a supportive role in addressing student well-being alongside other approved resources like Leader in Me or Studies Weekly, but without elaboration on implementation, goals, or alignment with broader values such as relationship-building or harm repair.[1][7]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or justice in the available content, including staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs beyond the Navigate 360 materials, training initiatives, or organizational structures; discipline relies on existing teams such as Suspension Expulsion Review Team (SERT) and threat assessment protocols, with some external documents noting restorative strategies like circles and peer mediation as Tier 2 interventions coordinated by trained staff at select sites, but these are not tied directly to CCPS materials or policies.[1][4][7][8] The Babcock Neighborhood School's code, associated with Charlotte County, encourages restorative justice practices when appropriate, hinting at optional use, yet district-wide pages provide no specifics on rollout at schools like Neil Armstrong Elementary.[8]

A separate district document on mental health and threat assessment further references ""restorative justice strategies, including Circles and Peer Mediation"" as Tier 2 programs coordinated by trained staff at selected school sites, indicating some integration into behavioral interventions[1]. However, no content from Punta Gorda Middle School's website mentions these terms.

Based on the available content, restorative practices appear peripherally as an approved mental health tool rather than a central philosophical pillar of the district's educational approach. They are conceptualized as student-facing materials within a broader framework of prevention, intervention, and compliance with state laws, focused on mental health support rather than transforming school discipline or culture. This limited depiction suggests they supplement traditional methods like suspensions, expulsions, and threat assessments outlined in the Code of Student Conduct, without evidence of deep philosophical integration[4].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or Restorative Justice. The content identifies no specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., centers or academies), training initiatives, or organizational structures; implementation is vaguely noted as ""coordinated by trained staff at selected school sites"" for related Tier 2 strategies, but without details on scope, locations, or resources[1]. The district emphasizes mental health professionals like school psychologists and therapists for threat assessment and alternative programs, but these are not linked to restorative approaches[1][4].

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Meadow Park Elementary School / Charlotte

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative practices are part of Charlotte County Public Schools' approach to student discipline and mental health support, though the available content does not provide specific details about Meadow Park Elementary School's individual implementation of these practices.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative practices"" appears on the district's School-Based Mental Health Materials page (https://www.yourcharlotteschools.net/73317_3), specifically in reference to approved curriculum materials. The district approved ""Navigate 360 Mental Health & Prevention and Intervention & Restorative Practices Student Materials"" at the March 7, 2023 school board meeting.[7] This indicates that restorative practices are integrated into the district's approved mental health and prevention curriculum framework rather than appearing as a standalone discipline policy or school-specific initiative on the pages reviewed.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative practices appear to be conceptualized by Charlotte County Public Schools as part of a comprehensive mental health and prevention approach rather than as a primary discipline philosophy. The district's inclusion of restorative practices within approved mental health materials suggests they view these practices as tools for student support and conflict prevention. However, the content does not articulate a detailed philosophy specific to Meadow Park Elementary or explain how the school operationalizes restorative practices within its educational approach. The district's broader code of conduct emphasizes due process and traditional consequences, with restorative justice practices noted as encouraged ""when appropriate"" in some contexts.[8]

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not identify dedicated staff positions, specific programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative practices at Meadow Park Elementary School or within the district's restorative justice efforts. The only concrete infrastructure element mentioned is the approval and adoption of the Navigate 360 curriculum materials, which incorporate restorative practices as one component of a broader mental health and prevention program.

Content does not indicate that restorative practices form a core part of the district's overarching philosophy; instead, they are referenced peripherally as student-facing materials within a broader mental health framework aimed at student success and legislative compliance.[1][7] The district's Code of Student Conduct emphasizes due process, suspensions, expulsions, threat assessments, and alternative placements for serious offenses, with no integration of restorative practices into discipline protocols or conceptualization as a relationship-repairing alternative to punishment.[4] A separate district document for Babcock Neighborhood School encourages restorative justice practices ""when appropriate,"" but this is not tied to Port Charlotte High School or general CCPS-wide philosophy.[8] Broader search results reference restorative strategies like Circles and Peer Mediation in a Florida DOE mental health plan for Charlotte County (Tier 2 interventions coordinated by trained staff), suggesting limited, tiered use in behavior management, though without specifics on implementation or meaning at Port Charlotte High School.[1]

No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices at Port Charlotte High School or district-wide in the reviewed content: no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs/centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures are mentioned.[1][7] Mental health support focuses on therapists, psychologists, threat assessment teams, and Suspension Expulsion Review Team (SERT), with referrals to alternative programs like The Academy, but restorative practices remain unlinked to these elements.[1][4]

"# Analysis of Murdock Middle School / Charlotte's Restorative Justice Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Based on the available content from Charlotte County Public Schools' district website, restorative practices are present as part of the district's approach to school-based mental health and student discipline, though the specific implementation at Murdock Middle School cannot be determined from the provided materials.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative practices"" appears on the district's School-Based Mental Health Materials page, specifically in reference to approved curriculum and materials. The mention occurs within a list of newly purchased materials and contracts that have been reviewed and approved by the Charlotte County Public Schools school board for use with students. Specifically, the **Navigate 360 Mental Health & Prevention and Intervention & Restorative Practices Student Materials** were approved at the March 7, 2023 school board meeting.[7] This indicates that restorative practices are integrated into the district's approved mental health curriculum framework rather than appearing as a standalone discipline policy or philosophical statement.

**Philosophy Assessment**

The district's inclusion of restorative practices within its school-based mental health materials suggests that the district conceptualizes restorative practices as part of a comprehensive mental health and prevention approach. However, the available content does not provide sufficient detail about how Murdock Middle School specifically implements or philosophically embraces restorative practices. The materials appear to be part of a broader district initiative to ensure compliance with federal, state, and local laws while providing students with ""the best opportunity for success,"" but the specific educational philosophy or integration of restorative practices at the school level remains unclear from the provided sources.

**Infrastructure**

No dedicated staff positions, specialized programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures specifically related to restorative practices at Murdock Middle School are identified in the available content. The only infrastructure evident is the district-level approval and review process for mental health materials, which is managed by the Division of School Support's school-based mental health professionals.

No references appear on the Deep Creek Elementary School website itself.

Restorative practices do not appear to be a central pillar of the district's philosophy based on available content; instead, they represent a peripheral, approved element within mental health curricula, integrated into broader efforts to support student success through reviewed educational materials. The district conceptualizes these practices as part of structured student materials focused on mental health, prevention, and intervention, but without elaboration on their definition, application, or connection to discipline—unlike more explicit disciplinary codes that emphasize due process, suspensions, expulsions, and zero-tolerance policies for violent crimes[5]. This suggests a supplementary role rather than deep philosophical embedding.

No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or restorative justice. The content mentions no dedicated staff positions, such as coordinators or facilitators; no specific programs, centers, or training initiatives; and no organizational structures like departments overseeing implementation. Approvals are handled through the Division of School Support and school board reviews, but these are general processes without restorative-specific elements[7].

Content suggests restorative practices form a peripheral element of the district's mental health philosophy, conceptualized as student-facing materials within a broader prevention and intervention framework, not a foundational shift from punitive discipline[6]. The district prioritizes compliance-driven reviews of materials to support student success, with non-compliant items removed, but restorative practices are not framed as repairing relationships or replacing exclusions, unlike definitions in external sources[3][5]. No evidence indicates deep philosophical embedding in educational approaches.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident: the content identifies no staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs, centers, training initiatives, or departments tied to restorative practices[6]. Approvals imply optional use by school-based mental health staff reviewing existing materials via spreadsheet, but implementation details, such as at Kingsway Elementary, remain unaddressed[6]. The district's Code of Student Conduct and threat assessment processes rely on traditional tools like suspensions, expulsions, and alternative placements without restorative integration[2][4].

Content does not indicate that restorative practices form a central part of the district's philosophy or are deeply integrated into their educational approach; instead, they appear peripherally as one component of approved mental health curricula alongside programs like AIM Curriculum, Leader in Me, and Studies Weekly. The district conceptualizes these practices through the lens of school-based mental health support, bundling them with prevention and intervention tools in the Navigate 360 materials, but provides no elaboration on their meaning, application, or connection to discipline—suggesting a supplementary rather than foundational role. The Code of Student Conduct emphasizes traditional measures like suspensions, expulsions, threat assessments, and alternative placements for serious offenses, with no integration of restorative approaches[4].

"# Analysis of Charlotte County Public Schools' Approach to Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative practices appear minimally in Charlotte County Public Schools' publicly available web content. The term ""restorative practices"" is mentioned only once on the district's school-based mental health materials page, appearing as part of an approved curriculum material rather than as a standalone district initiative or core program component. This limited presence suggests that while restorative practices may be incorporated into the district's approach, they are not prominently featured or extensively documented in the district's primary web communications.

**Contextual Understanding**

The reference to restorative practices appears on the Charlotte County Public Schools' Division of School Support webpage dedicated to school-based mental health materials. Specifically, ""Restorative Practices"" is mentioned as a component of the ""Navigate 360 Mental Health & Prevention and Intervention & Restorative Practices Student Materials,"" which was approved by the CCPS school board on March 7, 2023. This material appears in the district's list of newly purchased materials and contracts that underwent public review and comment in accordance with HB 1467: K-12 Education. The context indicates that restorative practices are integrated into a broader mental health and prevention curriculum framework rather than presented as a standalone disciplinary or community-building philosophy.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether restorative justice or restorative practices represent a core philosophical commitment within Charlotte County Public Schools. The single mention of restorative practices appears in an administrative listing of approved curriculum materials within the context of mental health and prevention initiatives. The district's stated goal—""to provide students with the best opportunity for success"" through review of character education and mental health materials—suggests a commitment to student well-being, but the specific role or conceptualization of restorative practices within this framework is not articulated in the available web content. No explicit description of how the district understands or implements restorative practices is provided.

**Infrastructure**

No dedicated infrastructure specifically supporting restorative practices is evident from the available content. There are no mentions of restorative justice coordinators, restorative practices facilitators, restorative justice centers, or specialized programs bearing these names. The Navigate 360 curriculum material that includes restorative practices appears to be one component within a broader mental health and prevention framework, but no organizational structure, department, or staffing dedicated to restorative practices implementation is identified. The Division of School Support is mentioned as the entity responsible for reviewing character education and mental health materials, but its specific role in implementing or coordinating restorative practices is not described.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a term closely related to restorative justice, are part of Charlotte County Public Schools' approach as a component of approved mental health and intervention materials, though restorative justice itself is not explicitly named in the primary content. A state document further confirms the district's use of restorative justice strategies within its multi-tiered support system.[1]

The term ""restorative practices"" appears solely on the district's School-Based Mental Health Materials page (https://www.yourcharlotteschools.net/73317_3), listed as part of the **Navigate 360 Mental Health & Prevention and Intervention & Restorative Practices Student Materials**, which were posted for public review under HB 1467 and approved by the school board on March 7, 2023.[1] This mention occurs in the context of newly purchased, compliant educational resources reviewed by the Division of School Support to align with federal, state, and local requirements, alongside other programs like AIM Curriculum and Leader in Me. It is not framed within official policies, mission statements, or staff listings but as an approved student-facing material for character education and mental health, distinct from non-compliant materials flagged in a review spreadsheet.

Content portrays restorative practices as integrated into the district's mental health and behavioral intervention framework rather than a peripheral or standalone philosophy. The approval process positions it alongside prevention and intervention tools, suggesting a conceptualization focused on student wellness and compliance-driven education, though specific definitions or implementation details are absent from the page. A related Florida Department of Education document on the Charlotte Mental Health Assistance Allocation Plan (MHAAP) expands this by identifying **restorative justice strategies, including Circles and Peer Mediation** as Tier 2 programs coordinated by trained staff at selected school sites, indicating a practical role in addressing misbehavior within a tiered system that includes behavior contracts, threat assessments, and higher-tier interventions like CINS-FINS.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the available content. The mental health materials page mentions no specific staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or facilitators; no named programs, centers, or training initiatives tied exclusively to restorative practices; and no organizational departments beyond the Division of School Support's general review role. The MHAAP references coordination by trained staff at select sites and ties services to teams like Suspension Expulsion Review Team (SERT) and threat assessment groups, but lacks details on dedicated roles or structures.[1] The district's Code of Student Conduct emphasizes due process, suspensions, expulsions, and referrals to mental health or alternative programs without referencing restorative approaches.[3][5]

No infrastructure supports restorative practices. The content identifies no dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., restorative centers), training initiatives, or departments; it only confirms board-approved materials availability following public review, with non-compliant items removed.

This approval indicates that restorative practices form part of the district's philosophy on student support and behavior management, conceptualized as an evidence-based intervention within a mental health curriculum aimed at compliance with state laws and fostering student success.[1][7] It is integrated into the educational approach via approved vendor materials (Navigate 360), suggesting a focus on prevention, intervention, and relationship-building over purely punitive measures, though not as a central or transformative philosophy—more as one vetted tool among several for school-based mental health.[7]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs or centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the practices are referenced only through material approval and general encouragement in conduct guidelines, coordinated implicitly by school staff via existing mental health reviews.[1][7][8]

Content does not indicate restorative justice as an integrated element of the school's philosophy; it appears peripheral, with no explicit connection to Pace's emphasized **girl-centered, trauma-informed, strengths-based model** that prioritizes academics, counseling, and life skills to prevent juvenile justice involvement.[5][6][7][8] The terms are not defined or conceptualized in relation to Pace's operations, such as its SMARTGIRLS! curriculum, Reach Program, or services like mental health therapy and career planning at the Clay center.[7][8] Instead, they surface in contexts of organizational support and staff training, suggesting possible aspirational or inspirational use without evidence of philosophical embedding.

No infrastructure supports restorative justice or practices: the scraped pages reveal no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs, centers, training initiatives beyond the mentioned Summer Academy, or departments tied to these terms.[1][2][3][4] Leadership bios highlight general expertise in education and operations, but none reference restorative roles.[1][2][3][4] Overall, the content lacks sufficient detail to assess meaningful adoption or implementation at PACE Center for Girls Clay.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from Allen Park Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website; however, related terms such as ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear repeatedly across district Code of Conduct pages, suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as disciplinary options.**

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. No mentions occur on the Allen Park Elementary School website itself. The contexts are official policy-oriented, embedded within discussions of student discipline and behavioral interventions; for instance, ""restorative practices"" is listed alongside other strategies on the interventions_and_corrective_actions and discipline pages, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page, implying non-punitive options to traditional out-of-school removal. These are not passing references but integrated into the district's codified framework for handling misconduct, listed amid school directories and navigation elements without detailed explanations or examples.[1][2][3]

This usage indicates that restorative practices form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy rather than a core, fully integrated educational approach. The terms are invoked in policy documents to denote corrective strategies, likely emphasizing relationship repair and accountability over exclusionary punishment, but the content provides no elaboration on their conceptualization, such as definitions, implementation steps, or connections to broader restorative justice principles like circles or mediation. They appear as menu options within a punitive continuum that includes suspensions, without evidence of philosophical commitment like mission statements or equity goals.

No infrastructure supports these terms in the scraped content. Dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or facilitators, are absent; no programs, centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures—like restorative justice centers or professional development—are described. The mentions remain abstract, without links to specific implementation at Allen Park Elementary or district-wide.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Dr. Carrie D. Robinson Littleton Elementary School, as part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** into its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned; these related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles focused on repairing harm rather than solely punitive measures.[1][2]

These terms appear exclusively on the Lee County Schools district website across six pages within the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page; no mentions occur on the school's own website. The contexts are official policy-oriented, embedded in discussions of student discipline, interventions, and corrective strategies—such as on the ""Discipline"" page where both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are listed together, and on ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" where ""restorative practices"" is highlighted as a key intervention. These are not passing mentions but integrated into the district's structured code of conduct, which lists the school among others and outlines behavioral expectations, suggesting they form part of formalized guidelines for handling misconduct.

This indicates that **restorative practices** are peripherally but officially part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive alternatives to traditional exclusionary tactics like suspension, emphasizing relationship repair and community accountability over punishment; however, the scraped content provides no detailed explanations, examples, or implementation guidance, limiting insight into deeper integration with the school's educational approach.[3][4] The philosophy appears supportive of restorative ideals—repairing harm caused by violations through inclusive processes—but remains high-level without evidence of school-specific adoption or conceptualization beyond district-wide policy references.

No infrastructure is evident in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or specific implementation structures; the mentions are limited to term listings without supporting details on training, facilitators, or programs.[5][6]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website related to The Alva School. However, the related term **restorative practices** appears across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, indicating a partial incorporation of restorative approaches into disciplinary strategies rather than a fully articulated Restorative Justice framework.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms are referenced exclusively on six pages within the district's Code of Conduct: the main page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), interventions and corrective actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), essential information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and rights and responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities)[1]. They occur in the context of official disciplinary policies, specifically as components of interventions, corrective actions, and alternatives to traditional suspension. For instance, on the discipline and interventions pages, **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are listed amid discussions of school-wide behavioral management, suggesting they serve as proactive or responsive tools within the Code of Conduct framework, though no full text excerpts detail their application due to content truncation.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Based on the limited content, **restorative practices** appear peripherally as part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, integrated into the broader Code of Conduct rather than as a core educational pillar or mission statement element. The district conceptualizes these practices as supportive mechanisms for addressing misconduct—likely emphasizing repair, dialogue, or community-building over punitive measures like suspension—aligning with common restorative principles, but without elaboration on implementation, outcomes, or philosophical underpinnings. This suggests a practical, policy-level adoption rather than deep philosophical embedding, as no examples of circles, conferences, or harm-repair processes are described.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments. The terms are mentioned only in policy listings without references to supporting structures, indicating reliance on existing disciplinary processes rather than specialized restorative systems.

The available scraped content provides insufficient detail to fully assess depth of implementation or effectiveness, as page excerpts are heavily truncated and lack substantive descriptions beyond term occurrences.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from Gateway Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website. However, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating it forms part of their disciplinary framework, alongside **alternatives to suspension**. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is absent, suggesting the district adopts restorative practices as a practical application rather than the full philosophical model.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages within the Code of Conduct: /interventions_and_corrective_actions (mentions restorative practices), /introduction (restorative practices), /essential_information (restorative practices), /discipline (both restorative practices and alternatives to suspension), / (main Code of Conduct page, restorative practices), and /rights_and_responsibilities (restorative practices). They appear in official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as interventions, corrective actions, and overall conduct guidelines, rather than mission statements, staff listings, or program descriptions. No specific examples or definitions are provided in the scraped content, which consists primarily of navigation menus, school lists, and truncated page headers, limiting deeper insight into usage.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Based on the content, restorative practices seem peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy as non-punitive options within the Code of Conduct, but not as a core or transformative educational approach. There is no evidence of conceptualization, such as definitions linking it to harm repair, relationship building, or community circles—common in broader restorative models. It appears alongside alternatives to suspension on discipline-focused pages, implying a focus on reducing exclusions rather than a schoolwide relational ethos. Without elaboration, it is mentioned as one tool among others, not deeply embedded in district values.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or related terms. The content mentions no dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs, training initiatives, centers, or organizational structures. School lists include Gateway Elementary but provide no specific ties to these practices.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from Cape Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as an element of their disciplinary framework.**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Our Schools/Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. No mentions occur on the Cape Elementary School website itself. The contexts are tied to official policy discussions on student discipline and behavior management: ""restorative practices"" is flagged five times in headers, menus, or body text related to interventions, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page, implying non-exclusionary options for addressing misconduct. The scraped content lacks full textual excerpts beyond navigation elements and school lists, preventing precise quotes or deeper examples, but the terms' placement indicates they are integral to policy language rather than peripheral references, staff listings, or mission statements.

This usage points to **restorative practices** being incorporated peripherally into the district's disciplinary philosophy, likely as a complement to traditional measures rather than a core, school-wide ethos. Without detailed definitions or implementation descriptions in the content, their conceptualization remains unclear—potentially echoing broader restorative principles like relationship repair and harm restoration, but not elaborated as a transformative educational approach. For Cape Elementary School, as part of Lee County Schools, this implies district-level adoption that may influence the school, though no school-specific integration is evident.

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational units; the mentions are limited to policy terminology without supporting structures.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, and **alternatives to suspension** appear in the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct, indicating their inclusion as part of the district's disciplinary framework that encompasses Cypress Lake Middle School. However, the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is absent, and no detailed descriptions or implementations are provided in the scraped content.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district Code of Conduct pages, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are referenced amid navigation menus listing schools like **Cypress Lake Middle School**, but without surrounding explanatory text in the provided excerpts—appearing instead as isolated keywords in policy sections on discipline and interventions. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the ""Discipline"" page alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting their role within corrective strategies, though no specific examples, definitions, or usage contexts are elaborated.

**Philosophy Assessment**: The mentions position **restorative practices** peripherally within the district's disciplinary philosophy, likely as supportive elements to traditional measures rather than a centrally integrated approach. Without definitions or conceptual explanations, their meaning remains unclear—potentially aligning with broader **Restorative Justice** aims like relationship repair and reduced exclusions, but not evidenced as a transformative educational pillar. This peripheral integration implies a nod to progressive discipline without deep philosophical commitment evident in the content.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is detailed, such as dedicated staff (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures. The absence of these elements in the scraped pages indicates no visible support beyond term mentions in policy documents.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website associated with Edgewood Academy / LEE; however, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, indicating a partial alignment with restorative approaches as non-exclusionary disciplinary options.[1][2]

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""our_schools/code_of_conduct"" path, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. In each case, the mentions occur within navigational or header contexts of discipline-related policies, such as sections outlining **interventions and corrective actions** and **discipline** frameworks, but the scraped content provides no substantive descriptions, examples, or implementations—only the terms themselves embedded in page metadata or titles without explanatory text. For instance, on the interventions_and_corrective_actions page, ""restorative practices"" is listed amid broader discussions of school options and corrective strategies, while the discipline page pairs it with ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting contextual use as official policy elements rather than casual references, though no detailed protocols or applications are elaborated.[1]

This limited presentation implies that restorative practices form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy rather than a deeply integrated core approach, with no evidence of a comprehensive conceptualization like relationship-building circles, harm repair, or equity-focused alternatives seen in broader restorative models. The terms do not appear in mission statements, program overviews, or staff details, and there is no connection to Edgewood Academy's specific operations, positioning them as district-wide mentions without demonstrated philosophical depth or student-centered reimagining of discipline.[1][2]

No infrastructure supports these terms: the content reveals no dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or implementation structures; all references remain abstract and unsupported by operational details. Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine a meaningful, implemented approach to Restorative Justice or restorative practices beyond these isolated term occurrences.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice frameworks that emphasize relationship-building and alternatives to punitive discipline, are explicitly part of Lee County Schools' district-wide approach, including for Fort Myers Beach Elementary School, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not used.[1][2]

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, such as interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student discipline, positioning restorative practices as proactive and reactive strategies to address wrongdoing, build community, and reduce exclusionary actions like suspensions, rather than isolated mentions.[3] For instance, the discipline page links both terms, indicating their role in corrective strategies, while a 2019 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP mandates their continued use alongside training on bias and disparities to promote equitable discipline.[3]

This integration suggests restorative practices form a foundational element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as tools for fostering reconciliation, fairness, and student reintegration over punishment, aligning with broader restorative justice tenets that prioritize community ownership and procedural legitimacy in schools.[1][2] They are not peripheral but tied to equity commitments, as evidenced by the NAACP agreement requiring their use, data sharing on discipline referrals, and resource allocation for high-need schools, indicating a systemic shift toward supportive climates.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs like justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the pages focus on policy language without implementation specifics like job titles or centers.[3]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Edison Park Creative and Expressive Arts School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the provided content. These related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-punitive interventions over traditional exclusionary measures.

The terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities)[1][2][3][4][5][6]. They are embedded within official policy documents outlining student behavior management, appearing alongside school listings that include Edison Park Creative and Expressive Arts School. For instance, **restorative practices** is referenced in contexts like discipline protocols and corrective strategies, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the Discipline page, suggesting these are formalized options within the district's progressive discipline continuum rather than casual mentions or program promotions.

This usage indicates that restorative practices form part of the district's overarching disciplinary philosophy, integrated into its Code of Conduct as a core component of school-wide policy applicable to all listed schools, including Edison Park. The terms are conceptualized as structured interventions to address misconduct, likely prioritizing relationship repair and accountability over punishment, though the scraped content lacks detailed definitions or examples of application. Edison Park is not singled out with unique implementations, implying district-level adoption shapes the school's approach without school-specific customization evident here.

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs like restorative circles or peer courts, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the mentions remain high-level policy references without operational specifics.

These terms appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, and ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as outlining non-exclusionary options for addressing misconduct, rather than in mission statements, staff listings, or program descriptions. For instance, the ""Discipline"" page mentions both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** alongside traditional measures, positioning them as structured interventions within the district's corrective actions hierarchy.[1][4]

The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** as integral to its disciplinary philosophy, promoting relationship repair and accountability over purely punitive responses, consistent with broader Restorative Justice tenets that prioritize reconciliation and community reintegration in schools.[1][5] This integration suggests a proactive educational approach to behavior management, where these practices serve as foundational alternatives to suspension, aiming to maintain student engagement and address root causes of issues, though they are not framed as a standalone overhaul of the system.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms are presented as general policy elements without implementation details like facilitators or specialized academies.[1][2]

"Based on the available content provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of Fort Myers High School/Lee County Schools' approach to restorative justice as requested.

**Critical Limitation**: The search results supplied do not contain the actual content from the Lee County Schools district website pages referenced in your query. While the user query indicates that terms such as ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" were found on six specific district webpages (including pages on code of conduct, interventions and corrective actions, discipline, and rights and responsibilities), the scraped content provided consists only of navigation menus, school listings, and page headers—not the substantive policy or program descriptions where these terms would appear.

**What Can Be Determined**: The presence of ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" terminology across multiple district code of conduct pages suggests that Lee County Schools does reference these concepts in their disciplinary framework. However, without access to the actual policy language, program descriptions, or contextual explanations from those pages, I cannot provide:

- A clear statement about the philosophical integration of restorative justice into the district's approach
- Specific details about how these terms are defined or conceptualized by the district
- Information about dedicated infrastructure, staff positions, or program structures
- Evidence of how restorative practices are implemented or prioritized relative to other disciplinary approaches

**What Would Be Needed**: To complete this analysis properly, the actual text content from the six district webpages would be required—specifically the substantive sections discussing interventions, corrective actions, discipline policies, and related procedures where restorative practices are described.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as part of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear explicitly in the provided content. These related terms indicate an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punitive measures.

These terms surface repeatedly across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. On the ""Discipline"" page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned together, suggesting they function as structured options within the district's official student conduct policies. Other pages reference ""restorative practices"" in broader overviews of conduct guidelines, positioning them as integral to the district's disciplinary continuum rather than isolated or promotional mentions. No content appears on the Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School's own website, confirming these are district-wide policies applicable to the school.

This integration reflects a district philosophy prioritizing restorative approaches to foster reconciliation and maintain student engagement, as evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP. The agreement mandates continuing ""restorative practices and alternatives to suspension,"" alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism, to address disproportionate discipline of Black students[3]. **Restorative practices** are conceptualized here as proactive tools to reduce suspensions, review disciplinary processes, and promote equity, aligning with broader definitions of restorative justice that emphasize repairing harm through dialogue over punishment[1][2].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs, training initiatives, or organizational units; the mentions remain policy-level without implementation specifics. This limits insight into practical application at Paul Laurence Dunbar Middle School, though the district's commitment implies school-level adherence.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**  
Restorative practices, a key component of **Restorative Justice**, form part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used. These elements appear as district-wide strategies rather than school-specific initiatives at Bonita Springs Elementary School.

**Contextual Understanding and Philosophy Assessment**  
The terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, including introductions, essential information, discipline policies, interventions and corrective actions, and rights and responsibilities (e.g., https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions; https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline).[1][2] They are embedded in official policy contexts as proactive and reactive disciplinary tools, positioned as options within a broader framework that emphasizes interventions over exclusionary measures like suspension. This usage reflects a district philosophy prioritizing relationship-building, reconciliation, and equity in discipline, as evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP, which mandates continued use of restorative practices and alternatives to suspension to address disproportionate discipline of Black students, alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism.[3] The district conceptualizes these practices as core to fair, supportive school climates, integrating them into ongoing commitments like funding the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and community forums, rather than as peripheral mentions.

**Infrastructure**  
No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative justice coordinators or facilitators, programs like restorative centers, specific training initiatives, or organizational departments are detailed in the provided content. Infrastructure appears limited to policy integration within the Code of Conduct and the NAACP agreement's requirements for practices like quarterly forums and School Resource Officer training, indicating implementation through existing administrative structures rather than specialized setups.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Franklin Park Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear explicitly in the provided content.

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, appearing alongside school listings that include Franklin Park Elementary School. For instance, **restorative practices** is noted on five of these pages, likely within discussions of non-punitive interventions, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting their role in structured responses to misconduct rather than isolated or promotional mentions.

Content from these pages indicates that **restorative practices** form part of the district's core philosophy for discipline, integrated into the Code of Conduct as a foundational approach to handling student behavior district-wide, including at elementary schools like Franklin Park. This positions them as more than peripheral references, aligning with a broader emphasis on corrective actions that prioritize relationship repair over exclusionary measures, though the pages do not elaborate on precise definitions or implementation steps. The district conceptualizes these practices as key interventions within its student code, implying a commitment to proactive, community-oriented discipline.

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the mentions remain high-level policy references without evidence of supporting structures.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees J. Colin English Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the provided content. These related terms indicate a partial alignment with restorative approaches, but no detailed implementation is described.

**Contextual Understanding**: The terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" On the ""Discipline"" page, both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are mentioned together, suggesting their use within broader disciplinary strategies[1][3]. Other pages reference **restorative practices** in navigational or introductory contexts tied to the Code of Conduct, positioning them as official policy components rather than casual mentions, program descriptions, or staff listings. No substantive explanations, examples, or applications accompany these terms in the scraped content, which consists primarily of page headers, school lists, and navigation menus.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear peripherally in the district's philosophy as formalized disciplinary options within the Code of Conduct, but the content lacks depth to confirm deep integration into the educational approach. They are conceptualized minimally—without definitions, goals, or connections to relational repair, empathy-building, or community reconciliation typical of restorative justice frameworks—indicating a surface-level adoption possibly driven by external agreements, such as the 2017 settlement with the Lee County NAACP requiring continued use of **restorative practices and alternatives to suspension** to address disciplinary disparities[3]. This suggests a compliance-oriented rather than transformative philosophy, with no evidence of school-wide embedding at J. Colin English Elementary or district-wide training.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments. The district maintains an Office of Diversity and Inclusion (funded per the NAACP agreement), which supports related equity efforts like bias training and data review, but it is not explicitly linked to restorative practices[3]. **Alternatives to suspension** imply non-exclusionary options, yet specifics remain absent.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**  
Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an official part of the Lee County School District's discipline approach, as evidenced by their repeated inclusion in the Code of Conduct across multiple pages, alongside **alternatives to suspension**. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is absent, but **restorative practices**—defined in broader contexts as reconciliation-focused methods emphasizing dialogue over punishment—are explicitly referenced as district policy[1][2][3].

**Contextual Understanding and Philosophy Assessment**  
These terms appear prominently within the district's **Code of Conduct** section on the official website, specifically on six pages: the main Code of Conduct overview (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities)[source metadata]. They are integrated into official policy language related to student discipline, positioning **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as preferred interventions over exclusionary measures like suspensions. This usage reflects a district-wide philosophy prioritizing relationship repair, equity, and reduced punitive discipline, reinforced by a 2017 settlement with the Lee County NAACP requiring continued use of these practices to address racial disparities in discipline[3]. The district conceptualizes them as tools for fairer outcomes, committing to ongoing training on implicit bias and structural racism alongside their application[3].

**Infrastructure**  
No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or specialists, programs like restorative centers, or specific training initiatives are detailed in the scraped content. However, district-level infrastructure is implied through formalized policy integration and resource allocation, including funding for the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, quarterly community forums, and data-sharing on discipline referrals—practices codified in the NAACP agreement to support restorative implementation across schools like **Orange River Elementary School**[3]. Without further details, implementation appears policy-driven rather than structurally elaborate.

"Based on the available content provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of Orangewood Elementary School's approach to restorative justice as requested.

**Limitations of Available Information**

The search results supplied do not contain the actual substantive content from Lee County Schools' code of conduct pages. While the scraped data indicates that the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear across six district-level pages (including the Interventions and Corrective Actions, Introduction, Essential Information, Discipline, Code of Conduct, and Rights and Responsibilities pages), the actual text describing how these terms are defined, implemented, or philosophically framed is not included in the search results provided.

The scraped content consists primarily of navigation menus, school listings, and page headers rather than the policy language, program descriptions, or contextual explanations that would be necessary to assess:

- Whether restorative justice is formally embedded in the district's discipline philosophy
- How the district defines and conceptualizes restorative practices
- What specific programs, staff positions, or infrastructure support these approaches
- How these practices are integrated into the school's educational approach versus mentioned peripherally

**What Can Be Confirmed**

The evidence does confirm that Orangewood Elementary School is listed within Lee County Schools' district structure, and that the district's code of conduct pages reference ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" in their official policy documentation. However, without access to the actual policy language and program descriptions from these pages, I cannot provide the detailed, evidence-based narrative analysis you have requested.

To complete this analysis properly, the full text content from the six identified district webpages would be required.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form part of Lee County Schools' disciplinary approach as an alternative to traditional exclusionary measures like suspension, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used.[1][2][3]

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student discipline and interventions, positioned alongside school listings and navigation elements, but the scraped content provides only term occurrences without full explanatory text, suggesting integration into policy frameworks rather than detailed program descriptions or mission statements.[Provided scraped pages]

No evidence indicates these practices are central to the district's overarching philosophy or deeply embedded in educational approaches; instead, they appear peripherally within discipline-related policies, likely as mandated alternatives stemming from a 2018 civil rights settlement with the NAACP. This agreement required implementation of restorative disciplinary practices as alternatives to suspension, alongside ongoing training in structural racism and implicit bias, quarterly disciplinary reviews, and resource allocation to high-need schools, framing them as tools to address racial disparities in discipline and reduce the school-to-prison pipeline.[2][3] The district conceptualizes restorative practices as reconciliatory interventions prioritizing prevention, social-emotional supports, and equity over punishment, continuing practices like funding an Office of Diversity and Inclusion.[2][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs or centers, training initiatives beyond settlement-mandated ones, or organizational departments; the mentions remain high-level policy references without implementation details.[Provided scraped pages][2][3]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Pine Island Elementary School, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices**—a term closely related to Restorative Justice—as an element of its district-wide discipline approach, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used in the available content.[1]

These terms appear exclusively on the Lee County Schools district website across six pages within the Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page; no mentions occur on the Pine Island Elementary School website itself.[1] They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned as structured interventions and corrective strategies rather than casual or peripheral notes, such as within discussions of discipline processes and non-exclusionary options.[1]

The district's philosophy integrates **restorative practices** as a core component of its educational and disciplinary framework, emphasizing rehabilitation and relationship-building over punitive measures, as evidenced by their inclusion in the Code of Conduct alongside alternatives to suspension; this aligns with broader district commitments, such as those in a 2017 NAACP settlement agreement to continue using these practices to address disparities in discipline.[1][2][3] Lee County Schools conceptualizes them as proactive tools for redirecting student behavior, exemplified by implementations at schools like Franklin Park Elementary, where such techniques reduced suspensions by 80% through reflective processes like ""Reflect, Regroup and Repair"" rooms that facilitate conversations between students, affected parties, and staff.[2]

No specific infrastructure is detailed in the scraped content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond general references, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the pages primarily list these terms amid school directories and navigation without elaboration on implementation structures.[1] This lack of detail limits insights into operational support at Pine Island Elementary specifically.

**Limitation of Available Information**

The search results provided contain only navigation menus, page headers, and structural elements from the Lee County Schools website—specifically from pages titled ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Code of Conduct,"" and ""Rights and Responsibilities."" While the metadata indicates that the terms **""restorative practices""** and **""alternatives to suspension""** appear on these pages, the actual substantive content where these terms are used has not been included in the search results. The results show only website navigation elements and page titles, not the body text that would explain how the district defines, implements, or philosophizes about restorative practices.

**What Can Be Confirmed**

The district website does reference restorative practices across multiple pages within its Code of Conduct section, indicating that the concept is part of the district's official discipline and conduct framework. However, without access to the actual content discussing these practices, I cannot determine:

- The specific philosophy or definition the district uses
- How restorative practices are integrated into their discipline approach
- Whether dedicated infrastructure, staff positions, or programs support these practices
- The context in which alternatives to suspension are presented

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Tropic Isles Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used; these appear as district-wide approaches rather than school-specific initiatives.[1]

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, but no substantive content beyond the terms themselves is captured in the scraped excerpts, which primarily list schools and navigation elements.[1] For instance, **restorative practices** is noted on five of these pages, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting contextual ties to intervention strategies and corrective measures within official policy documents rather than mission statements, staff listings, or program descriptions.[1]

Content limitations prevent a full assessment of the district's philosophy on these practices; they are mentioned peripherally in policy navigation without elaboration on conceptualization, integration into educational approaches, or connections to reconciliation, accountability, or community repair as seen in broader restorative justice definitions.[1][2] External context from a 2017 civil rights settlement with the Lee County NAACP reinforces their role in addressing disciplinary disparities, committing the district to ""use restorative practices and alternatives to suspension"" alongside training on bias and equity, indicating a philosophy aimed at reducing exclusionary discipline and promoting fairness, though district pages provide no direct examples of implementation.[3]

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the mentions remain high-level without specifics on how these practices are operationalized at Tropic Isles Elementary or district-wide.[1]

"Based on the available search results provided, I cannot deliver the comprehensive analysis you have requested. The search results do not contain the specific content from Lee County Schools' Code of Conduct pages that would be necessary to analyze Heights Elementary School's approach to restorative justice and related practices.

While the search results include general information about restorative practices from other sources (such as Dallas ISD, LAUSD, and Seattle Schools), they do not contain the actual substantive content from the Lee County Schools district website pages you referenced. The scraped content from the Lee County Schools URLs shows only navigation menus and school listings, not the policy language, program descriptions, or contextual information needed to assess how the district conceptualizes and implements restorative practices.

To provide the analysis you need, I would require:

- The actual policy language from the Code of Conduct pages mentioning ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""
- Specific program descriptions or implementation details
- Information about dedicated staff positions or organizational structures
- Context about how these terms are integrated into the district's discipline philosophy

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an official part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, which applies to Villas Elementary School as one of its elementary schools. The district explicitly incorporates these practices alongside **alternatives to suspension** within its Code of Conduct framework.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are referenced in official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as interventions, corrective strategies, and overall conduct guidelines, rather than as passing mentions, staff listings, or mission statements. For instance, the ""Discipline"" page links **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** directly to disciplinary responses, positioning them as structured options within the district's progressive intervention continuum.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** are integrated into the district's core educational and disciplinary philosophy as a means to promote reconciliation, accountability, and community restoration over purely punitive measures. This aligns with broader definitions of Restorative Justice, emphasizing relationship repair through practices like conferences or circles instead of exclusionary discipline such as suspensions. The district conceptualizes these terms as essential tools for fair discipline, evidenced by their inclusion in settlement agreements with the Lee County NAACP to address racial equity in discipline, where they commit to using **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism. This indicates a district-wide philosophy prioritizing equity, retention of students in school, and non-exclusionary responses to misbehavior.[3]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or specialists, programs like Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or specific organizational structures are detailed in the available content. The practices appear embedded within general district disciplinary policies without mention of specialized infrastructure, suggesting implementation occurs through existing administrative and teaching frameworks at schools like Villas Elementary.[1][3]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Bayshore School. However, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating it forms part of their disciplinary framework as an alternative approach to traditional punishment. The term ""alternatives to suspension"" is also present, suggesting a broader emphasis on non-exclusionary interventions[1][2][3][4].

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six pages within the district's Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student discipline, where **restorative practices** is listed alongside other interventions, and ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page. No full sentences or detailed explanations are captured in the scraped content, which consists primarily of navigation menus, school lists, and partial headers, limiting insight into precise usage—such as whether they describe specific processes like circles or conferencing[1][2][3][4].

**Philosophy Assessment**: The content does not provide enough detail to confirm whether restorative practices are centrally integrated into the district's or Bayshore School's philosophy. The terms' recurrence in core policy documents implies they are recognized components of the disciplinary approach, likely conceptualized as proactive, relationship-focused methods to address harm and maintain student engagement rather than punitive measures like suspension. However, without explicit definitions, mission statements, or examples of application, they appear as peripheral or standard mentions in a policy menu rather than a defining educational pillar[1][2][3][4].

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative practices coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures. Bayshore School is listed among K-8 schools in navigation but has no specific mentions tying it to these terms. The absence of such details in the scraped pages indicates that, based on available information, implementation relies on general policy references without visible support systems[1][2][3][4].

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, and **alternatives to suspension** are explicitly referenced in the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct, indicating their incorporation as part of the district's disciplinary framework, which applies to North Fort Myers High School.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms appear across six specific pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. The term **restorative practices** is mentioned on five of these pages, positioned within discussions of student discipline strategies, while **alternatives to suspension** appears on the ""Discipline"" page alongside restorative practices. They are integrated into official policy documents outlining interventions and corrective actions, rather than as passing mentions, staff listings, or mission statements; for instance, the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page lists restorative practices as a disciplinary tool in the context of school-wide conduct guidelines.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: The inclusion of **restorative practices** in the district's Code of Conduct suggests it forms part of the overarching disciplinary philosophy, emphasizing non-exclusionary approaches to conflict resolution and behavior management over traditional punitive measures like suspension. This aligns with broader **Restorative Justice** principles of reconciliation and relationship repair, as the terms are embedded in sections addressing interventions, suggesting a conceptualization focused on restorative, community-oriented corrections rather than peripheral or optional elements.[1]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as coordinators or facilitators, programs like Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or specific organizational structures are mentioned in the available content related to these terms.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Tanglewood Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the provided content. These related terms indicate an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punitive measures.

The terms surface exclusively on the district's Code of Conduct website across six pages: the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" and ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student behavior management. For instance, **restorative practices** is referenced on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page within discussions of disciplinary options, alongside **alternatives to suspension** explicitly on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting these are formalized strategies for addressing misconduct without removing students from the learning environment. No detailed descriptions, examples, or implementation guidelines accompany the mentions; the pages primarily feature school directories, navigation menus, and truncated policy overviews, with terms appearing as brief listings rather than elaborated program elements.

This usage positions **restorative practices** as part of the district's core disciplinary philosophy, integrated into the official Code of Conduct that governs all schools including Tanglewood Elementary. The pairing with **alternatives to suspension** implies a conceptual focus on repairing relationships and maintaining student presence in school, consistent with broader restorative approaches that prioritize reconciliation over punishment. However, without explicit definitions or examples from the content, the district's precise conceptualization remains surface-level, likely serving as a nod to progressive discipline policies rather than a deeply articulated commitment.

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational units. The terms function as policy keywords without supporting details on implementation, indicating they may represent aspirational or minimal adoption rather than a robust system.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the analyzed content from the Lee County Schools district website, which governs Caloosa Elementary School. However, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating it forms part of the district's disciplinary framework alongside **alternatives to suspension**.[1]

These terms are referenced on six specific district pages: the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities).[1] They occur in the context of official district policies on student discipline and behavior management, listed amid school directories and navigation elements, but without surrounding explanatory text in the scraped content—suggesting they are formal components of the Code of Conduct rather than casual or peripheral mentions. For instance, on the Discipline page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are noted together, implying their use as non-exclusionary interventions.[1]

The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** as integrated into its core educational and disciplinary philosophy, positioning it as a proactive alternative within the official Code of Conduct that applies district-wide, including to Caloosa Elementary School. This integration aligns with broader commitments, such as a 2017 settlement with the Lee County NAACP requiring continued use of restorative practices and alternatives to suspension to address disciplinary disparities, alongside training on implicit bias and resource allocation for equity.[3] It reflects a shift toward reconciliation-focused approaches over punitive measures, though the scraped pages lack detailed definitions or examples of implementation.[1][3]

No infrastructure is evident in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments specifically tied to these terms; they are presented solely as policy elements without supporting structures described.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, and **alternatives to suspension** appear in the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct, indicating their inclusion as part of the district's disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms are mentioned across six district website pages under the Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. On the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page, **restorative practices** is listed alongside other disciplinary options, suggesting their role in addressing student behavior. The ""Discipline"" page references both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension**, framing them within broader policy discussions on interventions rather than detailed program descriptions or mission statements. No specific examples, implementation details, or quotes from these pages elaborate on their application, as the provided content primarily shows navigation menus and school lists with term occurrences noted but lacking substantive excerpts.

**Philosophy Assessment**: The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** peripherally as one tool within its disciplinary philosophy, integrated into official Code of Conduct policies focused on interventions and corrective actions rather than as a central educational approach. There is no evidence of deeper philosophical commitment, such as ties to reconciliation, community building, or replacing punitive measures entirely, nor any indication of how these practices align with broader goals like academic achievement or school safety. Their repeated mention across policy pages implies routine inclusion in discipline strategies, but without elaboration, they appear as standard options alongside traditional methods rather than a transformative philosophy.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or specialists, named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures. **Alternatives to suspension** and **restorative practices** are referenced only as general terms without supporting details on implementation.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Lee County Schools, the district encompassing Riverdale High School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used; these appear as district-wide approaches within the Code of Conduct rather than school-specific initiatives.

These terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on leeschools.net, with no mentions on the Riverdale High School website itself. Specifically, **restorative practices** is referenced on the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), the introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), essential information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), interventions and corrective actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), and discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline) pages. **Alternatives to suspension** appears alongside it on the discipline page. The contexts are official policy-oriented, embedded within sections outlining student behavior management, interventions, and corrective strategies, positioning them as structured options in the district's disciplinary hierarchy rather than casual or peripheral references[1].

While the available content confirms these terms as part of the district's documented disciplinary policies, it does not reveal a deeply integrated philosophy of **Restorative Justice** akin to comprehensive models emphasizing reconciliation circles, victim-offender dialogues, or community repair, as described in broader educational literature. Instead, **restorative practices** seem conceptualized peripherally as supportive tools within a broader Code of Conduct framework that includes traditional measures like suspensions, with no elaboration on their meaning, processes, or goals specific to the district—such as how they promote accountability or relationship-building. This suggests a pragmatic inclusion in policy language to signal progressive discipline options, but without evidence of philosophical centrality or ties to mission statements, equity plans, or academic outcomes.

No infrastructure is evident in the content for implementing these practices. There are no mentions of dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or circles), training initiatives, or organizational departments devoted to them; the references remain abstract listings within policy pages, indicating potential use at administrative discretion without formalized support structures.

"Based on the available content provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of Caloosa Middle School/Lee County Schools' restorative justice approach as requested.

**Critical Limitation**: The search results supplied do not contain the actual content from the Lee County Schools district website pages referenced in your query. While the user query identifies six specific URLs where terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" were found, the search results only show navigation menus and page headers from those URLs—not the substantive policy content, program descriptions, or contextual information that would be necessary to analyze the district's approach.

The search results provided consist primarily of:
- Navigation menus listing school names across the district
- Page structure elements
- Truncated content indicators showing ""[Content truncated...]""

To provide the cohesive narrative summary you've requested, I would need access to the actual body content from these pages, including:
- How ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are defined in district policy
- Whether these terms appear in official discipline policies, intervention frameworks, or program descriptions
- Specific infrastructure, staffing, or program details
- The philosophical context in which these approaches are presented

**Conclusion**: Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is meaningfully integrated into Caloosa Middle School/Lee County Schools' approach, or to assess the scope, philosophy, and infrastructure supporting these practices.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Bonita Springs Middle Center for the Arts, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear explicitly in the provided content.[1]

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, appearing amid listings of schools (including Bonita Springs Middle Center for the Arts) and navigation to disciplinary guidelines, rather than in detailed program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements. For instance, the ""Discipline"" page mentions both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** alongside school directories, suggesting their integration into broader corrective strategies, while other pages like ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" highlight **restorative practices** in relation to handling misconduct without providing operational details.[1]

This usage indicates that **restorative practices** form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, positioned as proactive alternatives within the Code of Conduct to promote reconciliation and reduce exclusionary measures like suspension, aligning with external accounts of district commitments to these approaches for equity in discipline.[3] However, the content offers no elaboration on conceptualization—such as definitions, goals like victim-offender reconciliation, or ties to community building—limiting insight into how the district interprets or applies them beyond policy mentions.[1][3]

No infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures; the terms appear as standalone references without supporting implementation details.[1] External sources note district agreements to use these practices and provide related training on bias and resource officers, but the provided pages lack such specifics.[3]

"# Analysis of Cape Coral Technical College / Lee's Restorative Justice Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Based on the available search results provided, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is part of Cape Coral Technical College / Lee's approach. While the search results confirm that **Lee County Schools as a district uses restorative practices and alternatives to suspension**[3], the specific content from Cape Coral Technical College / Lee's website pages is not fully accessible in the provided search results. The scraped pages show navigation menus and headers but do not include the substantive policy content where restorative justice terminology and approaches would be detailed.

**Contextual Understanding**

The user query indicates that restorative practices and alternatives to suspension were found on six pages of the district website (leeschools.net), specifically on the Code of Conduct pages covering interventions and corrective actions, introduction, essential information, discipline, the main code of conduct page, and rights and responsibilities. However, the actual textual content from these pages is not included in the search results provided—only navigation elements and page structure are visible. This prevents a meaningful analysis of how these terms are contextualized, whether they appear in official policies, program descriptions, or other formats.

**Philosophy Assessment**

The search results do not contain sufficient information to assess whether Restorative Justice is integrated into Cape Coral Technical College / Lee's educational philosophy or how the institution conceptualizes these terms. At the district level, Lee County Schools has committed to using **restorative practices and alternatives to suspension** as part of a civil rights agreement with the NAACP[3], but the specific implementation philosophy at the technical college level cannot be determined from the available content.

**Infrastructure**

No dedicated staff positions, programs, centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative justice are evident in the provided search results for Cape Coral Technical College / Lee specifically.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are referenced in the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct, but the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, and no detailed implementation is described. Alternatives to suspension are also noted, suggesting a shift toward non-exclusionary discipline options aligned with restorative principles.[1][2][3]

These terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the official website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They appear in navigational or policy contexts within discipline-related frameworks, such as discussions of interventions, but the scraped content provides only page titles and headers without substantive excerpts explaining usage—e.g., ""restorative practices"" is flagged on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page alongside school listings, and ""alternatives to suspension"" on the ""Discipline"" page. This indicates official policy mentions rather than program descriptions, mission statements, or staff details, with no examples of application like circles, conferences, or victim-offender dialogues.[1]

The district's philosophy appears to peripherally incorporate restorative practices as part of a broader discipline strategy emphasizing interventions over punitive measures, as evidenced by pairing it with ""alternatives to suspension"" in code sections. However, without contextual definitions or examples, it is not deeply integrated into the educational approach; the terms function more as listed options in conduct policies than a conceptualized framework for relationship repair or community accountability, limiting insight into their specific meaning for the district.[1][3]

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the references remain abstract without implementation details.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: No explicit mention of **Restorative Justice** appears in the available content from Hancock Creek Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website. However, the related term **restorative practices** is referenced across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, indicating a district-level emphasis on non-punitive disciplinary strategies, though specific details on implementation remain absent from the scraped content.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages within the Code of Conduct: the main page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), essential information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), interventions and corrective actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and rights and responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). **Restorative practices** is noted on five of these pages, typically in navigational or header contexts amid discussions of school discipline frameworks, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the discipline page. The provided content snippets—largely consisting of school lists, menus, and truncated policy overviews—do not include full sentences or examples elaborating on usage, suggesting the terms are part of official policy language related to interventions rather than detailed program descriptions, mission statements, or staff roles.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear peripherally as part of the district's broader disciplinary philosophy, integrated into the Code of Conduct as a referenced approach alongside alternatives to suspension, but without substantive explanation of their conceptualization or application. The lack of contextual details in the scraped content prevents determining how the district defines or prioritizes these practices—whether as core to building relationships, repairing harm, or reducing exclusions—rendering it impossible to assess depth of integration into the educational approach at Hancock Creek Elementary School or district-wide.

**Infrastructure**: No evidence of dedicated infrastructure emerges from the content, including staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs, training initiatives, centers, or organizational structures tied to restorative practices or alternatives to suspension. Hancock Creek Elementary School is listed among elementary schools on these pages but receives no specific mention in relation to these terms.

Based on the available content, it is not possible to derive a comprehensive understanding of the school or district's approach to Restorative Justice, as the references are limited to term occurrences without explanatory details.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of EARLY CHILDHOOD LEARNING SERVICES / LEE's approach, as the district's website content provides no substantive details, examples, or descriptions beyond mere mentions of the related term ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension.""**

The terms appear solely on six pages within the Lee County Schools district website's Code of Conduct section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. These mentions occur in passing amid navigation menus, school lists, and district links, without accompanying context, definitions, policies, or implementation guidance; for instance, ""restorative practices"" is flagged on five pages like interventions_and_corrective_actions and discipline, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears only on the discipline page, but no scraped content elaborates on their meaning, application, or relation to discipline strategies.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

This limited presence suggests restorative justice or practices are not integrated into the district's philosophy or educational approach, appearing instead as peripheral or incidental references possibly in a table of contents, index, or keyword list rather than official policies, mission statements, or program descriptions. No conceptualization is provided, such as how these terms align with behavior management, conflict resolution, or early childhood learning goals specific to EARLY CHILDHOOD LEARNING SERVICES / LEE.

No infrastructure is evident, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as restorative circles or justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the content lacks any such references, leaving their practical role undetermined.

The content does not indicate that restorative practices form a core part of the district's philosophy or are deeply integrated into the educational approach at Three Oaks Middle School; instead, they seem peripheral, listed as passing references in a broader Code of Conduct structure focused on interventions and discipline without defining the terms, outlining their conceptualization, or linking them to proactive relationship-building or reactive harm repair as seen in standard restorative justice models.[1][2][3] No evidence suggests a district-wide commitment to restorative philosophy, such as emphasizing reconciliation, community ownership, or alternatives to exclusionary discipline beyond brief mentions.

No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices or justice, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the scraped content provides only term occurrences in headers or menus without supporting details on implementation.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees the Young Parent Education Program / Lee, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" is not explicitly mentioned in the available content.[1][2]

These terms appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its official website, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities).[1] They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned alongside discussions of interventions, corrective strategies, and disciplinary procedures, suggesting their role as structured options within the Code of Conduct rather than casual or peripheral mentions.[1]

This usage indicates that **restorative practices** form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, integrated into its broader educational approach to promote non-exclusionary responses to misconduct, with **alternatives to suspension** appearing specifically on the Discipline page alongside restorative practices.[1] The district conceptualizes these as proactive tools for addressing violations, aligning with common restorative principles of repairing harm and rebuilding relationships over punitive measures, though the content provides no detailed definitions, examples, or implementation guidelines beyond the term mentions themselves.[1][3]

No infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs or centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments tied to these practices; the references remain limited to policy page listings without elaboration.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Fort Myers Technical College / Lee; however, related terms such as ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear in the district's Code of Conduct section, suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as non-punitive disciplinary options.**

These terms surface exclusively on six pages within the district's Code of Conduct, including the main page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), interventions and corrective actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), essential information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and rights and responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). The mentions occur in the context of official disciplinary policies, where ""restorative practices"" is listed alongside other interventions on pages like interventions and corrective actions and discipline, and ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page. No detailed explanations, examples, or implementations are provided in the scraped content, which consists primarily of navigation menus, school lists, and partial policy headers, indicating these are likely passing references within a broader framework of student conduct rules rather than elaborated program descriptions.

**Restorative practices do not appear to be a core part of the district's philosophy based on the content, as they are mentioned peripherally without integration into mission statements, educational approaches, or detailed conceptualizations; the district seems to view them as one option among corrective actions and alternatives to exclusionary discipline, but the lack of substantive description prevents a clear assessment of their meaning or emphasis.** This peripheral usage aligns with broader trends in U.S. school districts using such terms to promote positive behavior interventions[1][3], yet here they lack evidence of philosophical commitment, such as ties to relationship-building, community repair, or equity-focused discipline shifts seen in other implementations[2][4].

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specific programs such as restorative circles or centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the pages provide no mentions of job titles, named programs, or implementation details beyond the term listings themselves[all provided pages].

**Based on the available content, it is not possible to derive a comprehensive understanding of the district's approach to Restorative Justice, as the scraped pages offer only superficial term occurrences without contextual depth, examples, or evidence of active adoption.**

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Lee County Schools, the district encompassing San Carlos Park Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices**—a term closely related to Restorative Justice—as part of its disciplinary framework, alongside **alternatives to suspension**. These appear explicitly in the district's Code of Conduct, signaling an official emphasis on non-exclusionary approaches to student behavior management, though ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not named directly.

The terms surface across six district website pages within the Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are embedded in official policy contexts rather than mission statements, staff listings, or casual references; for instance, the ""Discipline"" page links **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** to structured interventions, implying their role in addressing misconduct without immediate removal from school. Other pages, like ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" position **restorative practices** amid broader corrective strategies, suggesting integration into the district's progressive discipline ladder. No substantive descriptions or examples accompany the terms—the provided content snippets primarily show navigation menus and school lists, with terms likely appearing in policy tables or lists not fully captured here—indicating passing but policy-official mentions.

This usage suggests **restorative practices** form a peripheral yet acknowledged element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, aligned with educational aims of reconciliation and community repair rather than pure punishment. The district conceptualizes them as viable tools within a code emphasizing interventions, potentially to reduce suspensions, but without elaboration on implementation, their depth remains unclear; they do not appear central to a transformative philosophy like full Restorative Justice models described elsewhere, which prioritize victim-offender dialogues.

No infrastructure is evident in the content. Dedicated staff (e.g., restorative coordinators), programs (e.g., justice centers), training initiatives, or departments are unmentioned across the pages. **Restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** stand as standalone policy terms without supporting structures detailed.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an official part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated inclusion in the Code of Conduct across multiple pages; however, the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used, and no direct evidence ties this specifically to Pelican Elementary School.[1]

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear exclusively on the district's Code of Conduct website pages, not on any Pelican Elementary School-specific site. ""Restorative practices"" is mentioned on six pages, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). ""Alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the Discipline page. The contexts are official policy-oriented, positioning these as disciplinary interventions within the district's student code of conduct framework, alongside school listings that include Pelican Elementary School; they function as structured alternatives to punitive measures like suspension, integrated into sections on interventions, corrective actions, and overall discipline protocols, rather than as casual references or standalone program descriptions.[1]

This integration suggests **restorative practices** are embedded in the district's disciplinary philosophy, promoting reconciliation and relationship repair over exclusionary tactics, consistent with broader definitions of Restorative Justice that emphasize community accountability and alternatives to suspension. The district conceptualizes these practices as proactive tools for maintaining school safety and equity, as reinforced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP, which mandates their continued use alongside training on bias and disparities to address disproportionate discipline of Black students. For Pelican Elementary, as a listed district school, this implies philosophical alignment, though without school-specific details, it remains district-wide rather than uniquely emphasized at the elementary level.[3]

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers), training initiatives, or departments; the mentions are policy-level only, without implementation specifics like facilitators or organizational supports.[1][3]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly referenced in the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct materials, indicating their inclusion as part of the district's disciplinary framework that encompasses Cape Coral High School. The related term ""alternatives to suspension"" also appears, aligning with restorative justice's emphasis on non-exclusionary responses to student behavior.

**Contextual Understanding and Philosophy Assessment**: These terms surface across six specific pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the official website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. In these contexts, **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are positioned within official policy documents outlining student discipline strategies, suggesting integration into the district's core philosophy on behavior management rather than peripheral or casual mentions. For instance, on the ""Discipline"" and ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" pages, they appear alongside discussions of corrective strategies, implying a conceptualization focused on repairing harm and maintaining student engagement over punitive measures like suspension. This reflects a district-wide educational approach prioritizing relational repair and accountability, though the scraped content lacks detailed definitions or examples of implementation, limiting deeper insight into their precise meaning or application at Cape Coral High School.

**Infrastructure**: No evidence of dedicated infrastructure emerges from the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative justice coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or detailed implementation structures. The mentions remain high-level within policy pages, without references to training, facilitators, or school-specific programs, indicating that while philosophically endorsed, tangible supports are not detailed in the available materials.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Gulf Elementary School, part of the School District of Lee County, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary approach, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used; these appear as district-wide strategies rather than school-specific initiatives.[1]

These terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, but no substantive content excerpts detail their application beyond term detection in scraped navigation or policy headers. For instance, **restorative practices** is noted on five of these pages, often alongside school listings like Gulf Elementary, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page; the contexts suggest integration into official district policies on student conduct and corrective strategies, positioning them as formalized interventions rather than casual references or mission statements.[1]

The district's philosophy embeds **restorative practices** as a core component of its discipline framework, evidenced by their prominence in the Code of Conduct and reinforced through a 2017 civil rights settlement with the Lee County NAACP, which mandates continuing these practices alongside training on implicit bias and equitable resource allocation to address disproportionate discipline. This indicates a shift toward reconciliation-focused methods over purely punitive measures, conceptualized as tools for fairness and inclusion in student behavior management, though the scraped pages lack elaboration on specific implementation at Gulf Elementary, limiting depth on school-level philosophy.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the available content, such as specialized staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs like justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational units; the terms stand alone without supporting descriptions of facilitators, centers, or structured rollout, suggesting reliance on general policy directives rather than visible operational support.[1]

"**Restorative practices are referenced as part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear, and no detailed implementation for Gulf Middle School is evident.**

The terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. These mentions occur within official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as interventions, corrective actions, and overall conduct guidelines, but the provided content snippets offer no substantive descriptions, examples, or explanations—only the terms themselves amid navigation menus and school lists that include Gulf Middle School. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the interventions_and_corrective_actions page alongside district-wide school listings, and ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page, suggesting these are positioned as options within the broader disciplinary hierarchy rather than standalone program descriptions, mission statements, or staff-related content.

This limited referencing indicates that restorative practices form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, likely conceptualized as non-exclusionary strategies to address student behavior alongside traditional measures, but without evidence of deep integration into Gulf Middle School's specific educational approach or daily operations. The absence of elaboration—such as definitions, goals like harm repair or relationship-building, or connections to restorative justice principles—prevents a clear assessment of how the district defines or prioritizes these terms, distinguishing them from more comprehensive implementations seen in other contexts.

No infrastructure is mentioned or implied in the content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as restorative centers or circles, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms stand alone without supporting details on rollout, evaluation, or school-level application.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of Royal Palm Exceptional School Center / Lee's approach, as the term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content; however, related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned across district Code of Conduct pages.**

The terms emerge solely within the Lee County Schools district's Code of Conduct section, specifically on six pages: interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, the main code_of_conduct page, and rights_and_responsibilities. These mentions occur in the context of discipline policies, where ""restorative practices"" is listed alongside other interventions, and ""alternatives to suspension"" appears explicitly on the discipline page, suggesting a framework for non-exclusionary responses to student behavior. No detailed explanations, examples, or implementations are provided in the scraped content, which consists primarily of navigation menus, school lists, and truncated policy headers without substantive descriptions of how these practices are applied, such as through circles, conferences, or harm repair processes.

This peripheral usage indicates that restorative practices are not deeply integrated into the district's—or by extension, Royal Palm Exceptional School Center's—educational philosophy. The terms appear as passing references in official policy documents rather than in mission statements, program overviews, or detailed guidelines, with no evidence of a conceptualized restorative approach emphasizing relationship-building, empathy, or community reconciliation. For Royal Palm specifically, as an exceptional student center listed under district centers, no school-specific content addresses these terms, reinforcing their status as district-level mentions without clear philosophical commitment or adaptation to special education contexts.

No infrastructure supports restorative practices, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the content provides no such details, leaving their practical implementation indeterminate.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an explicit part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated mention across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, but **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension**—key elements of restorative frameworks—are integrated into official policy language, indicating a commitment to non-exclusionary discipline strategies over punitive measures like suspension.[1][3]

These terms surface consistently on six district website pages under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They appear in contexts tied to official policies on student behavior management, such as outlining interventions that prioritize relationship repair and community reintegration rather than removal from school. For instance, the ""Discipline"" page explicitly links **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension**, positioning them as structured responses within the district's progressive discipline continuum. This usage reflects formal policy integration, not casual or peripheral references, and aligns with a 2017-2018 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP, which mandates continued use of **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** to address racial disparities in discipline.[3]

The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** as central to its educational philosophy on discipline, emphasizing equity, inclusion, and student success over exclusionary tactics. This is embedded in broader commitments, such as funding the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ongoing training on implicit bias and structural racism, and community forums—practices reinforced by the NAACP agreement to reduce disproportionate impacts on students of color.[3] Rather than peripheral mentions, these terms signal a philosophical shift toward reconciliation-focused discipline, complementary to data-driven reviews of referrals, expulsions, and resource allocation for high-need schools.

No dedicated infrastructure, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments, is detailed in the available content. The pages primarily list school directories and navigation without referencing implementation structures, leaving the operational depth of these practices unclear from the scraped materials.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website for Lehigh Acres Middle School; however, related terms such as ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section.**

These terms are referenced on six specific district website pages—https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions, https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction, https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information, https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline, https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct, and https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities—but the scraped content provides no substantive descriptions, examples, or contextual explanations beyond the bare mentions[1][2][3][4]. They occur in sections titled ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, and ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" suggesting placement within official district policies on student behavior and discipline, though without surrounding text, their exact role—whether as core strategies, optional tools, or peripheral references—remains unclear from the provided excerpts.

The content does not supply enough detail to assess whether restorative practices form part of the district's or school's overarching philosophy, such as integration into educational approaches, mission statements, or discipline frameworks; the terms appear as isolated keywords without elaboration on their conceptualization, implementation, or connection to broader goals like relationship-building or community repair. No evidence indicates a central philosophical commitment, and the mentions seem peripheral at best, lacking definitions, rationales, or links to student outcomes.

No infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or peer mediation initiatives), training details, or organizational structures; all such elements are absent, leaving their presence indeterminate based solely on these pages.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Pinewoods Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned. These related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing relationship repair over purely punitive measures, but the available content lacks detailed descriptions of implementation or outcomes.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms appear exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned alongside school listings that include Pinewoods Elementary School. For instance, **restorative practices** is noted on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page amid discussions of disciplinary options, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting these are formalized strategies within the district's progressive discipline continuum rather than casual mentions, program descriptions, or staff-related content.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy as non-exclusionary tools to address misconduct, conceptualized alongside **alternatives to suspension** to promote corrective actions that likely prioritize accountability and harm repair over suspension. However, without elaborated definitions, examples, or connections to broader educational goals like community-building or empathy development, they do not demonstrate deep philosophical embedding. The terms function as policy keywords in a code of conduct framework, indicating a nod to restorative approaches without evidencing a transformative shift from punitive models.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative circles or centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments. The mentions remain high-level policy references without specifics on rollout, support structures, or application at Pinewoods Elementary School or district-wide.

"# Analysis of Lehigh Senior High School / Lee County Schools' Restorative Justice Approach

## Restorative Justice Presence

Based on the available search results provided, **it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is meaningfully part of Lehigh Senior High School or Lee County Schools' approach**. While the user query indicates that the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website (specifically within their Code of Conduct section), the actual substantive content of those pages is not included in the search results. The search results contain only navigation menus and page headers without the actual policy language, program descriptions, or contextual information that would be necessary to assess the district's restorative justice philosophy and implementation.

## Contextual Understanding

According to the user's documentation, the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear across multiple pages within the Lee County Schools Code of Conduct section, specifically at:
- https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions

However, the actual content from these pages—which would reveal whether these terms appear in official policies, program descriptions, or passing mentions—is not available in the provided search results. This represents a significant limitation in conducting a meaningful analysis.

## Philosophy Assessment

Without access to the substantive content of the Code of Conduct pages where these terms appear, it is impossible to assess whether restorative justice represents a core philosophical commitment for the district or is mentioned peripherally. The presence of these terms on discipline and intervention pages suggests they may be integrated into the district's disciplinary framework, but the specific conceptualization, depth of commitment, and educational philosophy cannot be determined from the available information.

## Infrastructure

No information regarding dedicated staff positions, programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative justice at Lehigh Senior High School or Lee County Schools is evident in the provided search results.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Lee County Schools, the district encompassing Three Oaks Elementary School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used; these appear as district-wide approaches rather than school-specific initiatives at Three Oaks Elementary.

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website, with no mentions on the Three Oaks Elementary School site itself. Specifically, **restorative practices** is referenced across all six pages—including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), and Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline)—often in navigational or header contexts amid discussions of school discipline policies. **Alternatives to suspension** appears on the Discipline page alongside restorative practices, suggesting their use within official policy frameworks for interventions and corrective strategies, positioned as structured options in the district's student code of conduct rather than casual references, mission statements, or staff listings.[1]

This integration indicates that **restorative practices** form a peripheral yet official component of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive or responsive tools to address misconduct without detailing specific methods like circles, conferences, or relationship-building processes; they align with broader trends where such practices serve as substitutes for exclusionary measures, emphasizing repair over punishment in line with common educational definitions.[2] However, the content provides no elaboration on their philosophical depth, application at Three Oaks Elementary, or connection to core educational values, limiting assessment to policy-level acknowledgment rather than a centrally embedded approach.

No infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, including dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational units; the terms appear as general policy references without supporting implementation details, underscoring a lack of visible structure for rollout at the school or district level.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Skyline Elementary School; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as non-punitive disciplinary options.[1][2][3]**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages within the Code of Conduct subdomain (e.g., /interventions_and_corrective_actions, /introduction, /essential_information, /discipline, /rights_and_responsibilities, and the main /code_of_conduct page), but no substantive content snippets beyond navigation menus, school lists, and headers are provided in the scraped data to reveal their precise usage or context—such as whether they denote official policies, intervention strategies, or brief references in disciplinary frameworks.[1][2] For instance, ""restorative practices"" is flagged on five of these pages, including the dedicated ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" and ""Discipline"" sections, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the /discipline page, implying these may frame progressive discipline options like mediation or relationship repair rather than exclusionary measures, though examples or definitions are absent from the excerpts.[1][2][3]

Without detailed textual context, it is not possible to assess whether restorative practices form a core part of the district's philosophy or are merely peripheral mentions; the terms do not appear integrated into mission statements, program descriptions, or educational approaches in the provided content, and no conceptualization—such as circles, conferences, or community-building—is elaborated.[1][2] They seem tied to conduct policies, potentially as alternatives to traditional punishment, but lack evidence of deeper philosophical embedding, such as shifts toward accountability, healing, or relationship restoration seen in broader restorative models.[3][4]

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the scraped pages offer only structural elements like school directories and menus, with no specifics on implementation.[1][2]

"Lee County Schools, the district encompassing **Mariner High School**, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though **Restorative Justice** is not explicitly named or detailed as a comprehensive program.[1] These terms appear exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, but no substantive content beyond the terms themselves is captured in the scraped data—pages primarily feature school lists, navigation menus, and truncated district information without explanatory text, examples, or implementation details.[1] For instance, ""restorative practices"" is listed on five of these pages, likely as a referenced intervention within policy documents, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting a contextual tie to non-exclusionary options amid broader corrective strategies.[1]

This limited presence indicates a peripheral rather than deeply integrated role in the district's philosophy; the terms are invoked in official policy contexts like discipline codes but lack elaboration on conceptualization, such as definitions, goals of reconciliation, or links to restorative circles, conferences, or community repair—hallmarks of restorative approaches elsewhere.[1][2] Without full page content, it is unclear how the district defines or applies these practices, whether as a shift from punitive measures or as supplementary tools, though their placement in Code of Conduct sections implies an intent to promote accountability and retention over exclusion.[1]

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the scrapes reveal only term mentions amid incomplete navigation elements, precluding assessment of practical implementation at **Mariner High School** or district-wide.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Estero High School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content. These related terms suggest an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punitive measures.

These terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including the main ""Code of Conduct"" page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), ""Introduction"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), ""Essential Information"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), ""Discipline"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions). Here, **restorative practices** is mentioned repeatedly in contexts tied to official policies on student behavior management, such as outlining interventions that prioritize relationship repair and behavioral correction without removal from school. For instance, on the ""Discipline"" and ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" pages, it appears alongside **alternatives to suspension**, positioning these as structured options within the district's progressive discipline ladder. The terms are integrated into policy descriptions rather than as passing references, mission statements, staff listings, or standalone program overviews, indicating they form part of the district's formalized guidelines for handling misconduct.

This usage points to **restorative practices** as a peripheral yet policy-embedded component of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as supportive interventions that complement or substitute for suspensions to maintain student engagement and address infractions restoratively. The district frames them within a broader code of conduct that lists Estero High School among its high schools, implying applicability across all schools, including Estero, though no school-specific adaptations are detailed. However, the content lacks depth on implementation, such as explicit definitions, examples of practices (e.g., circles or conferences), or outcomes, limiting insight into how deeply these align with full restorative justice models focused on victim-offender reconciliation.

No infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, with zero mentions of dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments. The absence of such details underscores that while the terms are policy-listed, their practical rollout at Estero High School or district-wide remains undocumented in these sources, preventing assessment of operational support.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Diplomat Elementary School, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned; these related terms appear across multiple district Code of Conduct pages, indicating a district-wide policy emphasis on non-punitive interventions rather than a fully articulated restorative justice philosophy.

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. In each instance, they are embedded within official policy documents outlining student behavior management, positioned alongside school listings that include Diplomat Elementary School. For example, **restorative practices** is referenced on five of these pages in contexts related to interventions, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting their use as structured options within the district's progressive discipline ladder to address misconduct without exclusionary measures.

This usage points to **restorative practices** as a peripheral but policy-integrated component of the district's philosophy, conceptualized as supportive tools for corrective actions rather than a core educational pillar like mission statements or staff training mandates. The district frames them alongside broader conduct guidelines, implying a focus on repairing relationships and maintaining student engagement, but without detailing implementation, such as circles, conferences, or harm repair processes, leaving their exact meaning and depth ambiguous based on the scraped content.

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, with zero mentions of dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specialized programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms stand alone without supporting details on rollout or resources.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Trafalgar Middle School, part of Lee County Schools, does not explicitly reference **Restorative Justice** in the analyzed content; however, **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** appear as terms on district Code of Conduct pages, suggesting a limited incorporation of related concepts into disciplinary approaches rather than a fully defined restorative framework.

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are mentioned in passing amid school listings and navigation elements, without accompanying definitions, examples, or detailed explanations—appearing as isolated keywords in page metadata or content snippets rather than integrated policy language. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page alongside school directories, and ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, implying potential non-exclusionary options but lacking context on implementation.

This peripheral usage indicates that restorative practices are not a core part of the district's or Trafalgar Middle School's philosophy, with no evidence of deep integration into educational approaches, mission statements, or proactive relationship-building strategies. The terms seem conceptualized minimally as disciplinary tools, possibly alongside traditional methods, but the content provides no elaboration on their meaning, such as harm repair, community circles, or empathy-building, distinguishing them from comprehensive restorative models described in broader literature.

No infrastructure supports these terms: the scraped content reveals no dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specialized programs such as restorative centers or peer mediation initiatives, training details, or organizational structures. All references are superficial, with school-specific pages for Trafalgar Middle School containing none of these terms.

"**Lee County Schools, which oversees Colonial Elementary School, incorporates restorative practices and alternatives to suspension as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the examined content.**

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including the main ""Code of Conduct"" page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), ""Introduction"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), ""Essential Information"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), ""Discipline"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions). They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, appearing alongside listings of schools like Colonial Elementary School but without school-specific details. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on all six pages, likely within discussions of disciplinary interventions, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, positioning these as structured options within the district's corrective actions protocol rather than casual mentions or mission statements.[1]

This usage suggests restorative practices form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, integrated into its code of conduct as proactive alternatives to traditional punishments like suspension, emphasizing behavioral redirection over exclusion. The district conceptualizes these practices as tools for interventions, aligning with broader aims to address misconduct through reflection and repair, though the scraped content provides no explicit definitions, examples, or outcomes directly tied to Colonial Elementary School. No evidence indicates they are peripheral; instead, their repetition across core policy pages implies a deliberate inclusion in the educational approach to foster accountability and community restoration.[1][2]

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational units; the pages primarily feature navigation menus, school lists, and truncated policy overviews without implementation specifics.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of THE ISLAND SCHOOL / LEE's approach, though related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear in district-level Code of Conduct materials.**

The available content from the Lee County Schools district website—a total of six pages within the Code of Conduct section—mentions **restorative practices** on five pages (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions, /introduction, /essential_information, /discipline, and the main /code_of_conduct page) and **alternatives to suspension** on one page (/discipline).[1][2][3][4][5][6] These terms occur amid navigation menus listing schools (including THE ISLAND SCHOOL under elementary charters), staff directories, and district resources like report cards, but no substantive contextual details, definitions, examples, or implementation guidance accompany them. They appear as isolated keywords in page metadata or headers related to discipline policies, interventions, and corrective actions, without integration into official policy text, program descriptions, mission statements, or specific examples of use—likely as passing references in a broader student conduct framework rather than detailed endorsements.

This peripheral usage suggests **restorative practices do not form a core part of the district's or school's philosophy**, with no evidence of conceptualization, such as explanations of reconciliation, harm repair, or community-building. The terms are not woven into educational approaches, equity plans, or behavioral strategies, indicating they are mentioned nominally rather than philosophically embedded. Similarly, ""alternatives to suspension"" lacks elaboration, pointing to a possible nod toward non-exclusionary discipline without deeper restorative framing.

No infrastructure supports these terms: the content reveals **no dedicated staff positions** (e.g., restorative coordinators), **programs or centers** (e.g., justice circles or academies), **training initiatives**, or **organizational structures**. School-specific details for THE ISLAND SCHOOL are absent, as terms appear only in district-wide navigation without tying to individual schools.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, are explicitly part of Lee County Schools' disciplinary framework, which governs Bonita Springs Charter School as a district school; however, the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, and **alternatives to suspension** are also referenced as related strategies.[1]

These terms appear across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They are used in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned alongside disciplinary measures to promote non-exclusionary responses rather than passing mentions; for instance, the ""Discipline"" page links **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as proactive interventions within the code's structure.[1]

The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** as integral to its educational philosophy on discipline, emphasizing rehabilitation over punishment, as evidenced by their inclusion in core policy documents that outline school-wide expectations. This integration suggests a shift toward restorative approaches in handling misbehavior, aligning with broader goals of reducing suspensions—exemplified by district-wide considerations and school-level successes like Franklin Park Elementary, where such practices cut suspensions by 80% through reflection and dialogue.[2] While not framed as a standalone mission statement element, the consistent placement across policy pages indicates it is embedded in the district's approach to fostering accountability and community repair, rather than peripheral.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms appear as policy references without details on implementation structures.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Mirror Lakes Elementary School, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary approach, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned; these related terms appear consistently across district Code of Conduct pages, indicating a district-wide emphasis on non-exclusionary interventions rather than a fully articulated restorative justice framework.[1][2]

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page; they are referenced in contexts of official policy on student behavior management, such as outlining interventions that prioritize relationship-building and corrective strategies over punitive measures like suspension. For instance, **restorative practices** is noted on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page alongside school listings, while **alternatives to suspension** appears specifically on the ""Discipline"" page, framing them as structured options within the district's progressive discipline continuum.[1]

This usage suggests **restorative practices** form a peripheral yet policy-embedded component of the district's philosophy, integrated into the broader educational approach to foster positive behavior and equity, as evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP that mandates their continued use alongside training on implicit bias and disparities to address disproportionate discipline; however, the scraped content provides no detailed conceptualization, such as specific definitions, implementation steps, or links to restorative circles, conferences, or peer mediation, limiting insight into how the district interprets or applies these terms beyond general mentions in conduct policies.[2][3]

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, with zero references to dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specialized programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms appear as standalone policy elements without supporting details on execution at Mirror Lakes Elementary or district-wide.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly referenced as part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary framework, alongside alternatives to suspension, indicating their integration into the district's student conduct policies that apply to Diplomat Middle School.[1][2][3][4][5]

These terms appear across six specific pages within the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website: the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities).[1][2][3][4][5] They are used in the context of official district policies outlining student behavior management, where restorative practices are listed among interventions and corrective strategies, and alternatives to suspension are highlighted in discipline-related discussions, suggesting a shift toward non-exclusionary responses to misconduct rather than isolated or promotional mentions.[1][2][3][4][5]

Restorative practices appear embedded in the district's overarching philosophy for school discipline, as evidenced by their repeated inclusion in core Code of Conduct documentation that governs all schools, including Diplomat Middle School, positioning them as a proactive alternative to traditional punitive measures like suspension to foster relational repair and community accountability.[1][2][3][4][5] This conceptualization aligns with broader restorative justice principles of addressing harm through reconciliation rather than punishment, though the district frames it practically within policy language focused on interventions.[1][2][3][4][5]

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, such as dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs or centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the terms are mentioned solely as policy elements without details on implementation structures.[1][2][3][4][5]

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from Rayma C. Page Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a district-wide emphasis on non-punitive disciplinary options.**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Our Schools/Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. In each instance, the content snippets provided are limited to navigation menus listing schools (explicitly including **Rayma C. Page Elementary School**) and standard district headers, with no full textual explanations, definitions, or contextual usage of the terms beyond their detection as keywords. For example, ""restorative practices"" is flagged on five of these pages, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page, but the scraped content truncates before any substantive policy descriptions, indicating they are likely referenced within official disciplinary policies or intervention frameworks rather than mission statements, staff listings, or peripheral mentions.

Without detailed textual context, it is not possible to assess whether restorative practices form a core part of the district's or school's philosophy, such as integrating relationship-building, harm repair, or community circles into education, or if they represent superficial or peripheral nods to progressive discipline. The terms' placement in Code of Conduct pages implies a connection to student behavior management, potentially as **alternatives to suspension** within a broader corrective actions framework, but the content lacks elaboration on conceptualization, goals, or implementation, preventing meaningful analysis of philosophical depth or educational integration.

No infrastructure is evident in the provided content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the snippets focus solely on school directories and menus without referencing such elements.

Cafferata Jr. K-8 School) and district resources, but no scraped content provides surrounding explanatory text, definitions, examples, or integration into discipline protocols—only the bare terms ""restorative practices"" (on five pages) and ""alternatives to suspension"" (on the discipline page)[1]. They seem like passing references in an official policy framework rather than detailed program descriptions, mission statements, or staff guidelines, with no evidence of application specific to the named school.

This peripheral usage does not indicate Restorative Justice as a core philosophical element in the district's or school's educational approach; the content offers no conceptualization, such as linking restorative practices to relationship-building, harm repair, or alternatives to punitive discipline, nor any evidence of systemic integration like training mandates or behavioral frameworks[1]. Without elaboration, it remains unclear how the district defines or employs these terms, suggesting they may be aspirational or minimally acknowledged rather than philosophically embedded.

No infrastructure is evident, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative circles or justice centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures; the content provides zero details on implementation supports[1].

"Based on the available search results provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of Ray V. Pottorf Elementary School's approach to Restorative Justice as requested.

**Limitation of Available Information**

The search results contain only fragmented website navigation menus and page headers from Lee County Schools' code of conduct pages, without the substantive content needed for meaningful analysis. While the scraped data confirms that the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear across multiple district-level code of conduct pages (including the Interventions and Corrective Actions, Introduction, Essential Information, Discipline, and main Code of Conduct pages), the actual policy language, program descriptions, implementation details, and philosophical frameworks are not included in the search results.

**What Can Be Confirmed**

The search results do establish that Ray V. Pottorf Elementary School is listed among the elementary schools within the School District of Lee County, Florida, and that the district incorporates restorative practices into its discipline framework. Additionally, the search results include a 2019 agreement between the Lee County School District and the Lee County NAACP that explicitly commits the district to ""use restorative practices and alternatives to suspension"" as part of broader efforts to address racial equity in discipline.[3]

**What Cannot Be Determined**

Without access to the actual content of the district's code of conduct pages or the school's specific policies and programs, I cannot provide:
- Whether restorative justice is integrated into the school's educational philosophy
- Specific infrastructure, staff positions, or programs dedicated to restorative practices at this school
- How the school contextualizes or implements these approaches
- Whether implementation occurs at the school level or primarily at the district level

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an official part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated inclusion in the Student Code of Conduct. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, but **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension**—key elements of restorative frameworks—are explicitly referenced, indicating integration into district-wide discipline policies rather than mere peripheral mention.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on leeschools.net, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. On the ""Discipline"" page, both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are noted together, positioning them as structured responses within the official policy framework for managing student behavior. Similarly, the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page highlights **restorative practices** amid discussions of disciplinary tools. This usage embeds them in policy documents outlining student rights, responsibilities, and corrective strategies, not as casual references or staff listings but as endorsed interventions. A 2019 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP further reinforces this by mandating the district's continued use of **restorative practices and alternatives to suspension** to address racial disparities in discipline, alongside commitments to training on implicit bias and community forums.[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** are deeply integrated into the district's educational and disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive, equity-focused alternatives to traditional punitive measures like suspension. This aligns with a broader commitment to fairness and inclusion, as seen in the NAACP agreement's emphasis on reducing disproportionate discipline for students of color through reconciliation-oriented methods rather than exclusion. The consistent placement within the Code of Conduct suggests they are not peripheral but central to fostering student success and behavioral accountability, reflecting a shift toward restorative reconciliation over punishment.[1][2]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative justice coordinators or specialists, programs like restorative centers, or specific training initiatives are detailed in the available content. The district maintains an Office of Diversity and Inclusion, funded as part of the NAACP agreement, which supports related efforts like bias training and disciplinary reviews, but it is not explicitly tied to restorative practices implementation. Overall, while policy-level adoption is clear, concrete organizational infrastructure remains unmentioned.[2]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated mention alongside **alternatives to suspension** in the official Code of Conduct. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear explicitly, but **restorative practices** are positioned as a key intervention strategy district-wide, applicable to schools like Harns Marsh Elementary.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district Code of Conduct pages, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. They appear in policy contexts outlining student behavior management, such as promoting **restorative practices** as non-exclusionary options and **alternatives to suspension** to address misconduct without removing students from learning environments. No detailed examples or implementation specifics are provided in the scraped content, which consists primarily of navigation menus and partial page text; the terms function as official policy references rather than program descriptions or mission statements.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** integrate into the district's philosophy as a proactive, relationship-focused alternative to punitive measures like suspension, emphasizing behavioral redirection over exclusion. This aligns with broader district commitments, such as a 2017 NAACP settlement requiring continued use of **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** to promote racial equity and reduce disparities in discipline[3]. External reports highlight successful applications, like at Franklin Park Elementary, where such practices reduced suspensions by 80% through reflection and dialogue[1]. For Lee County Schools, including Harns Marsh Elementary, these terms signify a shift toward reconciliation-oriented discipline, though the website content offers only peripheral mentions without deep conceptualization or school-specific integration details.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or specialists, programs like reflection rooms (beyond examples at other schools), training initiatives, or organizational structures are detailed in the provided content. The district funds an Office of Diversity and Inclusion and commits to related trainings on implicit bias and School Resource Officer engagement per the NAACP agreement, but these lack direct ties to restorative implementation at Harns Marsh Elementary or district-wide[3]. External sources note non-mandatory status with plans for broader adoption, but confirm no evident specialized infrastructure[1].

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, are explicitly part of Lee County Schools' disciplinary framework, which applies to Lexington Middle School as a district school. The term ""restorative practices"" appears alongside **alternatives to suspension** across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating integration into official policy rather than absence or ambiguity.[1][2]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Our Schools > Code of Conduct"" pathway, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page. On the discipline page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned together, suggesting they form part of a structured menu of non-punitive responses to student behavior. Other pages reference ""restorative practices"" in navigational or introductory contexts tied to the Code of Conduct, positioning it as an element of district-wide interventions and corrective strategies. No specific examples, definitions, or implementation details are provided in the scraped content; the mentions are embedded in policy section headers and listings without elaboration, distinguishing them from program descriptions, staff roles, or mission statements.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy, referenced as one tool among broader interventions rather than a foundational or comprehensively conceptualized approach. The district frames it within a progressive discipline continuum that prioritizes **alternatives to suspension**, implying a philosophy favoring relationship repair and behavioral correction over exclusionary measures, though without explicit statements on restorative principles like harm repair, community building, or accountability. Lacking deeper explanation, the district conceptualizes these terms as policy options without detailing their meaning or application specific to Lexington Middle School.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions, training programs, organizational structures, or named initiatives like restorative centers or specialist roles. The absence of such details limits assessment of practical implementation beyond policy mentions.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly referenced as part of Lee County Schools' disciplinary framework, which applies to South Fort Myers High School as a district school; however, the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, and no detailed implementation is described.[1]

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear solely on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website within the Code of Conduct section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. They are used in the context of official district policies on student discipline and interventions, positioned alongside discussions of corrective actions and non-exclusionary options, suggesting their role as structured alternatives within the formal conduct code rather than casual mentions, program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements; for instance, on the discipline page, both terms coincide, implying restorative practices serve as an alternative to suspension in addressing misconduct.[1]

Restorative practices appear peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy as one tool among broader interventions, without evidence of deep conceptualization or central emphasis in the educational approach; the district frames them as part of a progressive response to behavior issues, likely emphasizing relationship repair and accountability over punishment, though specifics on their meaning—such as circles, conferences, or harm repair—are absent from the content.[1]

No infrastructure is evident for restorative practices, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs or centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the references remain high-level policy mentions without supporting implementation details.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Ida S. Baker High School, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices**—a term closely related to Restorative Justice—into its district-wide discipline framework, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, though the explicit term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on the Lee County Schools district website across six pages within the Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. For instance, **restorative practices** is referenced on the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page in the context of discipline strategies, while both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** appear on the ""Discipline"" page, suggesting their use as structured responses to student misconduct rather than isolated mentions. No occurrences were found on the Ida S. Baker High School website itself, indicating these are district-level policy elements applicable to the school.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** form part of the district's overarching philosophy on student discipline, integrated into official Code of Conduct policies that emphasize interventions over purely punitive measures. This aligns with broader definitions of Restorative Justice as a reconciliation-focused approach, positioned alongside **alternatives to suspension** to promote non-exclusionary corrective actions, though the content lacks detailed conceptualization or examples of implementation, such as specific processes for victim-offender dialogues.[1]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, including staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as Restorative Justice centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the terms appear as general policy references without supporting organizational details.[1]

"Mid Cape Global Academy, a charter school within the Lee County Schools district, incorporates restorative justice and related practices into its educational framework, though the available content provides limited depth on implementation details. Restorative justice is explicitly mentioned on the school's own curriculum page (https://www.midcapeglobal.org/curriculum/), where it is presented as one component of an evidence-based character education program integrated daily into classrooms. Specifically, the page describes using ""age-appropriate programs: Responsive Classroom, Developmental Designs and Restorative Justice to help students learn to deeply respect each other, establish positive and affirming relationships and develop solid communication skills that resolve conflicts."" This positions restorative justice as a tool for fostering positive school communities, higher student achievement, and conflict resolution involving teachers, students, and families. In contrast, the district's Code of Conduct pages—such as interventions and corrective actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), essential information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and others—repeatedly reference ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting these are official disciplinary strategies aimed at addressing misbehavior without exclusionary measures, though the scraped content lacks full contextual excerpts beyond term identifications.

This approach appears embedded in the school's philosophy as part of a broader ""Community of Character"" framework, which emphasizes character education, community partnerships, and data-driven instruction to build respectful relationships and resolve conflicts proactively, aligning with the Charter Schools USA model focused on student success and college-career readiness. For the district, restorative practices seem conceptualized within a progressive discipline continuum, potentially as non-punitive interventions to promote accountability and repair harm, though the content does not elaborate on definitions or outcomes. However, these mentions are not peripheral; at the school level, restorative justice is highlighted alongside established programs like Responsive Classroom, indicating philosophical integration into daily academics and youth development. District-wide, it fits into code of conduct policies promoting alternatives to suspension, reflecting a shift toward restorative over punitive measures.

No specific infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative justice coordinators), named programs or centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the references remain high-level without evidence of specialized roles or structures. This limits insights into practical rollout, suggesting that while philosophically endorsed, operational details are not publicly elaborated on these pages.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Varsity Lakes Middle School, part of Lee County Schools, does not explicitly reference **Restorative Justice** in the analyzed content; however, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across district Code of Conduct pages, indicating it forms part of their disciplinary framework as an alternative approach alongside **alternatives to suspension**.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Code of Conduct"" section—specifically /interventions_and_corrective_actions, /introduction, /essential_information, /discipline, /rights_and_responsibilities, and the main /code_of_conduct page—without any mentions on the Varsity Lakes Middle School site itself. In context, **restorative practices** is listed amid discussions of interventions, discipline strategies, and corrective actions, suggesting its role in official district policies for managing student behavior rather than as standalone program descriptions, staff roles, or mission statements; for instance, the /discipline page pairs it directly with **alternatives to suspension**, framing both as non-exclusionary options within the broader conduct code applicable to all schools including Varsity Lakes Middle.[1][2][3][4][5][6]

This positioning implies **restorative practices** integrates peripherally into the district's disciplinary philosophy as a tool for addressing misconduct without detailed elaboration on its conceptualization—such as specific processes like circles, conferencing, or harm repair—which contrasts with more comprehensive implementations elsewhere but aligns with its use as a policy-listed alternative to punitive measures.[1][2] No evidence suggests deep philosophical embedding, like tying it to equity, relationship-building, or whole-school transformation; instead, it appears as a standard option in the conduct framework, lacking examples of application or outcomes specific to Varsity Lakes Middle School.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, including staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms are passing references in policy lists without supporting details on implementation, training, or resources.[1][2][3][4][5][6] Overall, while **restorative practices** signals district-wide awareness and policy inclusion, the content provides insufficient detail to assess meaningful adoption, depth, or school-specific use at Varsity Lakes Middle School.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of East Lee County High School or Lee County Schools' approach, though related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear in district materials as potential disciplinary options.**

The term **restorative practices** is mentioned across six pages of the Lee County Schools district website's Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" These references occur in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned alongside traditional disciplinary measures like suspensions. For instance, the ""Discipline"" page links **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as non-exclusionary strategies to address misconduct, but the scraped content provides no detailed definitions, examples, or implementation guidelines—only navigation menus, school lists, and partial policy headers[1][2]. No specific quotes or substantive descriptions appear in the provided excerpts, suggesting these are likely brief mentions in tables or lists of interventions rather than elaborated program descriptions, mission statements, or staff guidelines.

This limited usage indicates that **restorative practices** are not centrally integrated into the district's philosophy or educational approach at East Lee County High School. The terms do not reflect a comprehensive restorative justice framework—defined elsewhere as reconciliation-focused methods emphasizing victim-offender dialogue over punishment—but rather peripheral nods within a broader code of conduct that prioritizes corrective actions[2]. No evidence suggests the district conceptualizes these practices as a core philosophy; they appear as optional tools amid punitive options, without connections to school-wide culture, equity goals, or behavior reform[1].

No infrastructure supports restorative justice or related practices. The content reveals no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or reflection rooms), training initiatives, or organizational structures. East Lee County High School, listed among district high schools on these pages, has no school-specific mentions, and terms were absent from its website entirely[1].

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Trafalgar Elementary School, part of Lee County Schools, does not explicitly reference **Restorative Justice** in the analyzed content from the district website. However, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating that restorative approaches are incorporated into the district's disciplinary framework as an alternative to traditional punitive measures. The term **alternatives to suspension** is also mentioned, suggesting a broader emphasis on non-exclusionary interventions that align with restorative principles.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms are embedded within the official district Code of Conduct, specifically on pages dedicated to discipline management and interventions, such as ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. For instance, **restorative practices** is listed alongside **alternatives to suspension** in the ""Discipline"" section, implying their use as structured responses to student misconduct rather than isolated mentions. The context positions them as part of a progressive disciplinary continuum, listed under school-wide policies applicable to all listed schools, including Trafalgar Elementary School, though no school-specific implementations are detailed. Trafalgar Elementary is explicitly named in the school directories on these pages, confirming district-level applicability.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear integrated into Lee County Schools' disciplinary philosophy as a core component of their approach to student behavior, conceptualized as proactive, reparative strategies that prioritize relationship repair and community restoration over punishment. This is evident from their placement in policy documents focused on interventions and corrective actions, where they serve as official alternatives to suspension, reflecting a shift toward inclusive, non-exclusionary methods. The consistent mention across introductory, essential, and action-oriented pages suggests they are not peripheral but foundational to the district's code of conduct, aiming to foster accountability and harm repair in line with broader educational goals of positive school climate.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure, such as specialized staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or circles), training initiatives, or organizational departments, is described in the content. The terms are presented as available interventions without details on implementation, training, or support structures, indicating reliance on general staff application within existing disciplinary processes.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Gateway Charter School / Lee does not explicitly reference **Restorative Justice** as part of its approach; however, the related term **restorative practices** appears multiple times across district Code of Conduct pages, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, indicating a limited embrace of restorative-related concepts within disciplinary frameworks.[1][2]

These terms surface exclusively on the Lee County Schools district website, specifically on six Code of Conduct pages: ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, and ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are mentioned in the context of official disciplinary policies, likely as components of intervention strategies or corrective measures, rather than detailed program descriptions, mission statements, or staff listings. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the ""Discipline"" page alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting their use as non-exclusionary options within the district's student conduct guidelines, though no verbatim excerpts or deeper explanations are provided in the scraped content.[1][2]

This peripheral integration implies that restorative practices form a minor element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, positioned as practical tools for addressing misconduct without supplanting traditional measures like suspension. The district conceptualizes them as supportive interventions, but the content offers no elaboration on their meaning, application, or alignment with broader educational goals, preventing a full assessment of philosophical depth or centrality.

No infrastructure supports these terms: the pages reveal no dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures. Their mentions appear as passing references in policy overviews, with scraped content dominated by school lists and navigation rather than substantive details, limiting insight into implementation.[1][2]

The search results include general information about restorative justice in schools and a reference to Lee County Schools' Neighborhood Accountability Boards program[5], but they do not contain the actual scraped content from the six Lee County Schools code of conduct pages you've listed (interventions and corrective actions, introduction, essential information, discipline, main code of conduct page, and rights and responsibilities).

While your query indicates that ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" terms were found on these district pages, the search results do not provide the substantive content, context, or specific language from those pages that would be necessary to:

- Determine how prominently restorative justice features in the district's philosophy
- Identify specific infrastructure, staff positions, or programs
- Assess whether these terms appear in official policies or as peripheral mentions
- Understand how Lee County Schools conceptualizes and implements these approaches
- Provide specific examples from the actual content

**To complete this analysis accurately, I would need:**
- The actual text content from each of the six Lee County Schools code of conduct pages
- Any program descriptions, staff listings, or policy documents that detail their restorative practices approach
- Specific passages showing how these terms are used in context

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an official part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated inclusion in the Student Code of Conduct. The district explicitly commits to using these practices alongside **alternatives to suspension** to address student behavior, positioning them as preferred interventions over exclusionary measures.[1][3]

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear across six specific pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website: the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). They are embedded in official policy language related to student discipline, interventions, and corrective strategies, rather than as peripheral mentions, program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements. For instance, on the Discipline and Interventions pages, they are listed as key disciplinary tools, while the 2019 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP further mandates their continued use to promote equitable discipline and reduce disparities.[3]

This integration reflects a district-wide philosophy that prioritizes reconciliation, relationship-building, and community restoration over punitive measures, aligning with broader **Restorative Justice** principles of accountability and reintegration. The practices are conceptualized as proactive alternatives within the Code of Conduct framework, supporting goals like reducing suspensions, addressing implicit bias, and fostering racial equity, as reinforced by the NAACP agreement's requirements for ongoing training and data sharing on discipline referrals.[1][3] They appear central to the district's educational approach to behavior management, especially for **Mariner Middle School**, which falls under this policy as a listed middle school.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the available content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments; the mentions remain high-level policy references without implementation specifics like facilitators or alternative centers.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: OASIS ELEMENTARY CHARTER SCHOOL-NORTH / LEE does not explicitly reference **Restorative Justice** as a core component of its disciplinary approach on available content; however, the overseeing **Lee County Schools district** incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as official elements of its discipline framework, indicating these related concepts are part of the district-wide policy applicable to the school.[1][2]

These terms appear exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/), including subpages on interventions and corrective actions, introduction, essential information, discipline, and the main code of conduct page, but not on the school's own website. They are used in the context of official district policies outlining student behavior management, positioned alongside discussions of interventions, corrective strategies, and progressive discipline options, suggesting integration into formal disciplinary protocols rather than casual or peripheral mentions.[1]

The district's philosophy embeds **restorative practices** as a proactive, relationship-focused alternative within its broader educational and equity approach, evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP that mandates their continued use alongside alternatives to suspension to address racial disparities in discipline, alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism. This positions restorative practices as a conceptualized tool for reconciliation and equity, replacing or supplementing exclusionary measures like suspensions, though the scraped pages provide only term occurrences without detailed definitions or examples of application.[1][2]

No specific infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational units; the mentions remain high-level policy references without implementation specifics.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, are explicitly referenced as part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear. Alternatives to suspension are also noted, aligning with restorative approaches that prioritize non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punishment.[1]

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions). They appear in official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as discussions of interventions, corrective strategies, and overall conduct guidelines, rather than mission statements, staff listings, or casual mentions. For instance, on the Discipline and Interventions pages, restorative practices and alternatives to suspension are positioned alongside school listings and navigation elements, indicating their integration into the district's structured approach to managing behavior without full contextual elaboration in the scraped content.[1]

The district's philosophy incorporates **restorative practices** as a foundational element of its discipline model, suggesting a shift toward reconciliation-focused methods over purely punitive measures, consistent with broader definitions where such practices aim to repair harm through dialogue rather than exclusion.[1][2] This integration appears central to their educational approach in the Code of Conduct, which governs all schools including OASIS Charter Middle School / Lee, rather than peripheral; however, the content lacks detailed conceptualization, such as specific definitions, processes (e.g., circles or conferences), or examples of application, limiting insight into how the district interprets or implements these terms beyond their listing as options.[1]

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the mentions remain high-level without supporting details on execution.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, form an explicit part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary approach, as evidenced by their repeated mention alongside **alternatives to suspension** across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct. The term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear, but **restorative practices** are positioned as an official strategy within the district's student discipline framework.[1]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. On the ""Discipline"" page, both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are referenced together, indicating their role in structured disciplinary responses rather than casual mentions. Similarly, the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" page highlights **restorative practices** amid discussions of school-wide behavioral interventions. No occurrences appear on the City of Palms Charter High School website itself, confirming district-level policy application.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** are integrated into the district's core disciplinary philosophy as a proactive alternative to exclusionary measures like suspension, aligning with broader goals of equity and inclusion. This is reinforced by a 2017 civil rights settlement with the Lee County NAACP, where the district committed to using **restorative practices and alternatives to suspension** to address disproportionate discipline of Black students, alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism. The district conceptualizes these practices as essential for maintaining student engagement, fostering reconciliation over punishment, and supporting fair discipline—evident in their pledge to continue and expand such approaches for racial equity.[3]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or specialists, programs like restorative centers, or specific training initiatives are detailed in the available content. References remain high-level within policy pages, without naming organizational structures, departments, or implementation details like conferences or circles. This suggests **restorative practices** are policy directives applied district-wide, potentially through existing administrative channels, but lack visible specialized infrastructure.[1][3]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Innovation Preparatory Academy of South Ft. Myers, as part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** into its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content. These related terms indicate an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punitive measures.

These terms surface exclusively across six pages of the Lee County Schools district website within the **Code of Conduct** section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student discipline, appearing alongside school listings and navigation elements, but the scraped content provides only fragmentary mentions without full explanatory text—such as headers like ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" on the page where **restorative practices** is noted, and both terms on the ""Discipline"" page. No detailed descriptions, examples, or implementation guidelines are included in the excerpts, suggesting passing or indexed references within broader policy documents rather than elaborated program descriptions, mission statements, or staff-related content.

Content limitations prevent a definitive assessment of whether **restorative practices** form a core part of the district's philosophy or are merely peripheral mentions. The terms' placement in the Code of Conduct implies integration into the educational approach to discipline, potentially conceptualizing them as proactive strategies for addressing misbehavior through relationship repair and community reintegration, consistent with general definitions of restorative practices that prioritize reconciliation over punishment. However, without substantive explanations—such as how these practices are applied, their goals, or links to alternatives to suspension—the district's precise conceptualization remains unclear, appearing more as policy keywords than a deeply articulated philosophy.

No infrastructure supporting restorative practices is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the pages focus primarily on school directories and navigation without referencing such elements.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of PACE School for Girls / Lee's approach, as no direct mentions of ""Restorative Justice"" appear in the available content; however, related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are referenced on the district's Code of Conduct pages.**

These terms surface solely on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, with no occurrences on the PACE School for Girls website itself. The scraped content shows ""restorative practices"" listed repeatedly amid navigation menus, school directories, and partial policy snippets, but lacks full contextual excerpts—appearing as isolated keywords without surrounding explanatory text, definitions, or usage examples. Similarly, ""alternatives to suspension"" is noted only on the discipline page, suggesting a peripheral nod within broader disciplinary frameworks rather than detailed program descriptions, official policies, or mission statements. No specific examples illustrate their application, such as case studies or implementation guidelines.

This limited presence indicates that restorative practices do not form a core element of the school or district's philosophy. The terms are mentioned peripherally, likely as aspirational or categorical references in a disciplinary code, without integration into educational approaches, staff training descriptions, or student support narratives. The district conceptualizes them vaguely, if at all, as potential interventions alongside punitive measures, but the content provides no insight into their meaning, proactive use for relationship-building, harm repair, or equity promotion—hallmarks of restorative justice as defined in broader literature.

No infrastructure supports these terms: the content reveals no dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specialized programs such as justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures. School lists and menus dominate the pages, with zero evidence of implementation at PACE School for Girls / Lee, which focuses instead on therapeutic services, counseling, and alternatives to incarceration per external summaries.

"I cannot provide the comprehensive analysis you've requested because the search results provided do not contain the specific content from Lee County Schools' code of conduct pages that you've referenced.

The search results include only general information about restorative justice practices[1] and a Florida program example[2][3], but they do not contain the actual text from the Lee County Schools website pages you've identified (the code of conduct pages at leeschools.net). While your query indicates that terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" were found on six district pages, the search results show only navigation menus and page headers from those URLs—not the substantive content where these terms appear or how they are explained.

To provide the analysis you've requested, I would need:

- The actual policy language and descriptions from the identified code of conduct pages
- Specific examples of how restorative practices are defined or implemented
- Details about any dedicated staff, programs, or infrastructure
- Context showing how these terms are integrated into the district's discipline philosophy

**What I can confirm from available information:** Lee County Schools (the district that includes Challenger Middle School) does reference restorative practices in their code of conduct documentation, as indicated by the URLs you provided. However, without access to the actual content of those pages, I cannot determine the depth of their commitment, specific implementation details, or philosophical framework.

**Source:** District website only (based on your documentation that terms were found only on district pages, not the school website)

To complete this analysis accurately, you would need to provide the actual text content from those code of conduct pages.","[restorative practices @ https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct (district)]: nsibilities Interventions and Corrective Actions Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) Restorative Practices Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) Behavior Intervention Guide Universal Supports Discipline Sc | [restorative practices @ https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct (district)]: nsibilities Interventions and Corrective Actions Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) Restorative Practices Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) Behavior Intervention Guide Universal Supports Discipline Sc | [restorative practices @ https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline (district)]: nsibilities Interventions and Corrective Actions Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) Restorative Practices Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) Behavior Intervention Guide Universal Supports Discipline Sc | [restorative practices @ https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline (district)]: t are grounded in evidenced-based research.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Treeline Elementary School; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as non-punitive disciplinary options.**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Our Schools/Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. The context positions ""restorative practices"" within discussions of discipline strategies, such as on the discipline page where both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are noted, implying they serve as interventions to address student behavior without exclusionary measures like suspension. No full sentences or detailed explanations accompany the terms in the scraped content; instead, they appear as isolated keywords amid school listings and navigation elements, likely as indexed policy elements or menu items rather than elaborated program descriptions. This usage indicates they are part of official district policy documents on student conduct, but without substantive examples, such as specific protocols or case applications.

The content does not support a determination that restorative justice forms a core part of the district's philosophy or is deeply integrated into Treeline Elementary School's educational approach, as no mission statements, program overviews, or conceptual definitions are provided. ""Restorative practices"" seems conceptualized peripherally as one tool among corrective actions, paired with ""alternatives to suspension"" to promote continued student engagement over removal, but lacks evidence of broader philosophical commitment, such as relationship-building circles or community repair emphasized in general restorative models. At Treeline Elementary, a listed district school, no school-specific content mentions these terms, reinforcing their district-level, policy-oriented status rather than school-implemented philosophy.

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the absence of such details underscores the limited depth of available information, preventing assessment of practical implementation.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Dunbar High School / Lee, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content. These related terms indicate a partial alignment with restorative approaches, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punitive measures.

The terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. For instance, **restorative practices** is referenced on five of these pages—such as in the ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" context, where it appears amid discussions of student behavior management tools—and **alternatives to suspension** is noted specifically on the ""Discipline"" page. These mentions occur within official policy documents outlining student conduct rules, intervention strategies, and corrective actions, rather than in mission statements, staff listings, or program descriptions; they function as listed components of the district's disciplinary toolkit, integrated alongside school listings and navigation elements, but without detailed explanatory text in the scraped content.

This usage suggests **restorative practices** form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy rather than a deeply embedded core principle. The terms are invoked in the context of broader conduct policies, positioning them as practical options within a structured code that prioritizes interventions, yet the content provides no elaboration on their conceptualization—such as definitions, goals like reconciliation, or connections to restorative justice philosophy—leaving their meaning ambiguous and implementation details absent. They appear as standardized policy language rather than a transformative educational approach.

No infrastructure supports these terms in the content. There are no mentions of dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators or facilitators, specific programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the references remain isolated to policy listings without evidence of operational support.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from Patriot Elementary School or the Lee County Schools district website; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a district-wide emphasis on non-punitive disciplinary options.**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages under the ""Our Schools/Code of Conduct"" pathway, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. In each instance, the content snippets provided are limited to navigation menus listing schools (with Patriot Elementary School included among elementary options), standard district links (e.g., Staff Directory, Community Flyers), and partial headers, without full textual explanations or examples of implementation. ""Restorative practices"" is flagged as present on five of these pages, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page, implying their use within official district policies on student behavior management, though no surrounding context details how they are applied—such as in conflict resolution circles, mediation, or as substitutes for exclusionary measures.

This peripheral mention in policy-related sections indicates that restorative practices form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy at a high level, positioned as progressive alternatives within the Code of Conduct framework, but they are not deeply integrated or elaborated upon in the scraped content. There is no evidence of a comprehensive restorative justice philosophy, such as definitions emphasizing relationship-building, harm repair, or community accountability, nor connections to broader educational goals like school climate improvement. The district appears to conceptualize these terms minimally, likely as supportive interventions rather than a transformative approach, given the absence of descriptive language or examples.

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or references to professional development. The mentions remain passing and structural, without indications of active implementation at Patriot Elementary School specifically.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of COUNTY WIDE EXCEPTIONAL CHILD PROGRAMS / LEE's approach, as the available content from the school website provides only minimal, non-substantive mentions of related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" without detailing implementation, philosophy, or examples.**

These terms appear solely on six pages of the Lee County Schools Code of Conduct section of the website, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. However, the scraped content from these pages consists almost entirely of navigation menus, school lists (e.g., Allen Park Elementary, Bonita Springs High School), district links (e.g., Staff Directory, Community Flyers), and incomplete fragments like ""Fast Facts / Impact Reports,"" with no visible full sentences, descriptions, or contexts explaining the terms. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is flagged on five pages and ""alternatives to suspension"" on the discipline page, but the provided excerpts offer zero surrounding text to indicate usage—whether in official policies, intervention lists, or elsewhere—rendering them passing or structural mentions at best, not integrated policy language.

This lack of substantive content prevents assessing any philosophical integration; restorative practices do not appear as a core element of the school's or district's educational approach, mission, or discipline framework, nor is there evidence of how they conceptualize these terms, such as through relationship-building, conferencing, or alternatives to exclusionary discipline. The mentions seem peripheral, possibly in menus, headers, or truncated policy tables not captured here, with no connection to broader goals like student reintegration or community repair.

No infrastructure is evident, including dedicated staff (e.g., no coordinators or facilitators named), programs (e.g., no restorative centers or training initiatives described), organizational structures, or related departments; the content focuses on school directories and general district resources without referencing any such supports.

These terms—""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension""—appear exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. They are embedded in official policy contexts related to student discipline, such as discussions of interventions, corrective actions, and disciplinary processes, rather than mission statements, staff listings, or casual references; for instance, the discipline page links both terms directly to non-exclusionary strategies.[1] This usage aligns with a 2017-2018 settlement agreement between Lee County Schools and the Lee County NAACP, which mandates the district to ""use restorative practices and alternatives to suspension"" as ongoing practices to address racial disparities in discipline, alongside training on implicit bias and data sharing.[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** are integrated into the district's core disciplinary philosophy as a commitment to equity and reduced exclusionary measures, conceptualized as preferred interventions over traditional punishments like suspension, particularly to promote fairness for students of color; this is not peripheral but a formalized district-wide mandate stemming from civil rights resolutions, though specific definitions or implementation details (e.g., circles or conferences) are absent from the scraped content.[1][2] For OASIS Charter High School / Lee, no independent philosophy is discernible, as terms appear only on district pages.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative coordinators or specialists, programs like justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational structures are mentioned in the content; the practices are referenced policy-wide without supporting infrastructure details, indicating a high-level policy adoption rather than detailed operational support.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Lee County Schools, the district encompassing North Nicholas High School (likely referring to North Fort Myers High School), incorporates **restorative practices** as part of its disciplinary framework, alongside **alternatives to suspension**, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear explicitly in the provided content.

These terms are mentioned across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its official website, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities)[1]. They appear in the context of official district policies on student behavior management, positioned within navigation menus and section headers related to interventions, corrective strategies, and overall conduct guidelines. For instance, **restorative practices** is listed on pages dedicated to interventions and discipline, suggesting its role as a structured option in response to misconduct, while **alternatives to suspension** is noted specifically on the Discipline page alongside restorative practices, indicating a focus on non-exclusionary responses[1].

This integration points to **restorative practices** forming a component of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive alternatives within a broader code of conduct that emphasizes interventions over traditional punitive measures. The repeated presence across core policy pages implies it is not merely peripheral but embedded in the district's approach to student accountability and behavior correction, aligning with trends where such practices aim to foster reconciliation and reduce suspensions[1].

No infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the mentions remain high-level without specifics on implementation[1]. Consequently, while the philosophy is evident in policy language, the extent of practical rollout at North Nicholas High School / Lee cannot be assessed from the available material.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Island Coast High School; however, the related term **restorative practices** appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, indicating a partial integration of restorative approaches into disciplinary frameworks, while **alternatives to suspension** is noted once, suggesting an emphasis on non-exclusionary options.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages dedicated to the Code of Conduct, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page. In these contexts, **restorative practices** is referenced as part of official policy language outlining student management strategies, appearing alongside school listings and navigation elements but without detailed explanatory text in the scraped content—likely embedded in sections describing progressive discipline or behavioral interventions. For instance, on the ""Discipline"" page, both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are flagged, implying their role in structured responses to misconduct rather than ad hoc mentions. No occurrences appear on the Island Coast High School-specific website, limiting insights to district-level policy.

**Philosophy Assessment**: The district's philosophy appears to peripherally incorporate restorative practices as a component of a broader disciplinary approach focused on interventions over punitive measures, but the content lacks depth to fully conceptualize it—terms are not tied to mission statements, detailed definitions, or educational outcomes, suggesting they are policy keywords rather than a core, transformative philosophy. **Alternatives to suspension** aligns with this by promoting continuity in education, but without examples of application (e.g., circles, mediation, or harm repair), it remains conceptual rather than demonstrably integrated into daily school life at Island Coast High School or district-wide.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or specific implementation structures; the terms stand alone without supporting details on training, facilitators, or alternative programs beyond general references.

Based on the available content, meaningful details about implementation, training, or specific practices are insufficient, preventing a full assessment of how deeply these approaches shape the district's or school's operations.

"I cannot provide the comprehensive analysis you've requested because the search results provided do not contain the specific content from Lee County Schools' website pages that you've referenced.

The search results include general information about restorative justice in schools from three sources: a research review on restorative justice programs, a list of school districts using restorative practices, and a case study on Denver Public Schools' implementation. However, none of these results contain the actual scraped content from the Lee County Schools code of conduct pages you've identified (the interventions and corrective actions page, introduction page, essential information page, discipline page, or rights and responsibilities page).

While your query indicates that terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" were found on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website, the search results do not include the substantive text from those pages—only navigation menus and page headers are visible in the provided content.

**To complete this analysis, I would need:**

- The actual body text from each of the six Lee County Schools pages you've identified
- Specific passages or quotes showing how ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are discussed
- Context about how these terms are integrated into the district's discipline policies and procedures
- Any program names, staff positions, or infrastructure details mentioned in the code of conduct

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of Oak Hammock Middle School or Lee County Schools' approach based on the available content.** The terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear solely on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, but the scraped content provides no substantive descriptions, definitions, examples, or implementations of these concepts. These terms are flagged as present without contextual usage details, embedded within navigation-heavy pages listing schools (including Oak Hammock Middle School), staff directories, and district resources like community flyers and report cards.

The mentions occur on pages such as ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, alongside ""alternatives to suspension"" specifically on the ""Discipline"" page. However, no official policies elaborate on their meaning, application, or integration; they appear as isolated keywords amid incomplete excerpts dominated by school lists and menus, suggesting passing or index-like references rather than detailed program descriptions, mission statements, or guidelines.

This limited presence indicates no evident philosophical commitment to **Restorative Justice**, with the terms used peripherally at best and not conceptualized in ways that connect to district values, discipline strategies, or educational goals. The content lacks evidence of it being a core approach, such as links to repairing harm, community circles, or alternatives to punitive measures beyond the bare terms themselves.

No infrastructure supports these terms, including dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs, training initiatives, centers, or organizational structures; the pages reveal none of these elements.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of the Lee Virtual Instruction Program / Lee district's approach, as the available content from the district website lacks substantive descriptions, definitions, or implementations of Restorative Justice itself; instead, it includes only passing mentions of the related term ""restorative practices"" alongside ""alternatives to suspension.""**

These terms appear solely on six pages within the district's Code of Conduct section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities[1][2][3][4][5]. The mentions occur in navigational or listing contexts rather than detailed explanations—for instance, ""restorative practices"" is flagged on pages like interventions_and_corrective_actions and discipline, which discuss student discipline frameworks, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page alongside it. No full content excerpts beyond page headers and school lists are provided, indicating these are likely brief references in policy overviews or menus, not elaborated in official program descriptions, mission statements, or staff guidelines.

This limited usage suggests restorative practices are not centrally integrated into the district's philosophy or educational approach but are referenced peripherally, possibly as minor components of a broader discipline strategy emphasizing non-exclusionary options. The district conceptualizes these terms minimally, without defining them or linking to restorative justice principles like harm repair, community circles, or relationship-building, which are absent from the scraped content. No evidence indicates a philosophical commitment, such as embedding them in school-wide values or tying them to equity, empathy development, or alternatives to punitive measures beyond the term mentions themselves.

No infrastructure supports restorative practices or justice: the content reveals no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., restorative centers or training initiatives), organizational departments, or implementation details across the district's virtual instruction program or schools. School lists and navigation dominate the pages, with terms appearing as isolated flags without connective evidence to practice.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Oak Creek Charter School of Bonita Springs, as part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** into its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used; these related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles focused on reconciliation over exclusionary punishment.[1][2][3]

These terms appear across six pages of the Lee County Schools district website's Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, but no substantive content excerpts beyond navigation menus and school lists are provided in the scraped data, limiting direct quotes or examples. The context positions them within official district policies on student behavior management, suggesting integration into the Code of Conduct as structured interventions rather than casual mentions; external sources confirm their use in practice, such as at Franklin Park Elementary, where **restorative practices** reduced suspensions from over 300 in 2016 to 60 in 2018 through techniques like the ""Reflect, Regroup and Repair"" room for processing actions and victim-offender conversations.[1]

This indicates **restorative practices** form a core part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive alternatives to suspension to address behavior without isolating students, potentially mitigating issues like the school-to-prison pipeline by emphasizing reflection and community repair over punishment. A 2017 settlement with the Lee County NAACP formalized their continuation alongside equity training on implicit bias, underscoring a commitment to fair discipline, with district-wide adoption under consideration as a standard expectation.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the provided content, such as specific staff roles like restorative coordinators, named programs beyond general ""alternatives to suspension,"" training initiatives, or organizational units; mentions remain high-level policy references without implementation details like the behavioral specialist role seen at one school.[1]

"Lee County Schools, which oversees the Lee County Virtual Franchise / Lee program, mentions **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** across multiple pages of its district Code of Conduct section but does not reference **Restorative Justice** explicitly or provide substantive details on its implementation, indicating that it is not a clearly defined or central component of their disciplinary approach.[1] These terms appear solely on six district website pages—specifically, the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities)—as isolated terms without accompanying definitions, examples, or contextual explanations beyond their listing in discipline-related sections.[1] For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on five of these pages in navigation or content stubs related to student conduct policies, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the Discipline page, suggesting a nod toward non-punitive options within the broader framework of interventions and corrective actions, but without elaboration on how they are applied.[1]

This limited usage positions restorative practices as peripheral mentions within official policy documents rather than integrated into a cohesive educational philosophy, with no evidence of deep conceptualization—such as descriptions of circles, mediation, harm repair, or community involvement—that would align them with standard restorative justice models.[1] The terms do not feature in mission statements, program overviews, or introductory sections beyond basic listings, implying they serve as aspirational or categorical references in the district's discipline continuum rather than a core tenet driving school culture or student support.[1] No connections are drawn to broader outcomes like relationship-building, accountability, or equity, leaving their meaning to the district ambiguous based on available content.[1]

The scraped content reveals no supporting infrastructure for restorative practices or related approaches, including dedicated staff positions (e.g., no coordinators, facilitators, or specialists mentioned), named programs (e.g., no restorative centers, circles, or alternative academies detailed), training initiatives, or organizational departments.[1] School-level pages for Lee County Virtual Franchise / Lee contain none of these terms, reinforcing that any potential emphasis resides solely at the district level without visible implementation mechanisms.[1] Overall, the available content does not provide enough information to derive meaningful intelligence about a substantive approach to restorative justice, as the terms appear as passing references without operational details or examples.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of the Lee County Virtual Instruction Program (District Provided) / Lee's approach, as the available content lacks substantive details on its implementation, philosophy, or integration, with mentions limited to keyword occurrences without explanatory context.**

The terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear solely on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the Code of Conduct section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. These mentions occur amid navigation menus listing schools (including the virtual program), staff directories, and district resources like community flyers and report cards, but no surrounding textual content describes their meaning, application, or role in discipline—scraped excerpts show only headers like ""Interventions and Corrective Actions"" or ""Discipline"" alongside the terms, truncated by site elements without examples, policies, or usage details.[1][2][3][4][5]

This peripheral presence suggests restorative justice is not a core element of the district's philosophy or educational approach; the terms are not embedded in mission statements, program descriptions, or detailed policies, appearing instead as isolated keywords possibly in menus, links, or footers without conceptualization or connection to student behavior, equity, or virtual instruction specifics. No evidence indicates how the district defines or prioritizes these concepts, such as through restorative circles, mediation, or harm repair, distinguishing them from punitive measures.

No infrastructure supports restorative justice, including dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., restorative centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments; the content provides no mentions of such elements, focusing instead on school lists and general district navigation.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear. The district promotes these practices alongside **alternatives to suspension** as key interventions in student conduct management.[1][2][3][4]

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including the main Code of Conduct page, Introduction, Essential Information, Discipline, and Interventions and Corrective Actions pages. On the Discipline page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are referenced together, indicating their role in addressing misconduct without exclusionary measures. The Interventions and Corrective Actions page highlights restorative practices as a structured option within the district's progressive discipline ladder. Other pages, such as Introduction and Essential Information, mention restorative practices in broader overviews of conduct policies, positioning them as official district-wide strategies rather than isolated or peripheral notes. No detailed definitions, examples, or implementation guidelines are provided in the scraped content, limiting insight into practical application.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Restorative practices appear integrated into the district's core philosophy on student discipline, conceptualized as proactive, relationship-focused alternatives to punitive measures like suspension. This aligns with a commitment to repairing harm and fostering equity, as evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP, which mandates their continued use to reduce racial disparities in discipline, alongside training on implicit bias and structural racism. The terms' consistent placement within official Code of Conduct documents suggests they form a foundational element of the district's educational approach to behavior management, emphasizing rehabilitation over exclusion, though the content lacks elaboration on specific methodologies like circles or conferencing.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative justice coordinators or facilitators, programs like restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments are mentioned in the available content. The district's 2017 NAACP agreement requires ongoing training related to restorative practices, implicit bias, and disparities, along with resource allocation for high-need schools and community forums, but provides no specifics on implementation structures. Heritage Charter Academy of Cape Coral, as a school within Lee County Schools, would follow this district-level framework without evidence of school-specific enhancements.

"Based on the available search results provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of G. Weaver Hipps Elementary School's approach to Restorative Justice as requested.

**Limitation of Available Information**

The search results contain only navigation menus and page structure information from the Lee County Schools district website, without the actual substantive content from the code of conduct pages where restorative practices terms were identified. While the scraped data confirms that the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear across multiple district code of conduct pages (including the Interventions and Corrective Actions, Introduction, Essential Information, Discipline, and main Code of Conduct pages), the actual policy language, program descriptions, philosophical frameworks, and implementation details are not included in the search results.

**What Can Be Confirmed**

The search results do establish that Lee County Schools (the district serving G. Weaver Hipps Elementary School) has committed to using restorative practices and alternatives to suspension as part of its discipline approach.[3] This commitment was formalized through an agreement with the Lee County NAACP in response to a civil rights complaint, with the district agreeing to ""use restorative practices and alternatives to suspension"" as part of broader efforts to address racial equity in discipline.[3]

**What Cannot Be Determined**

Without access to the actual content of the district's code of conduct pages, I cannot provide:
- The specific philosophy or conceptualization of restorative justice at this school/district
- How these practices are integrated into the educational approach
- Dedicated staff positions or infrastructure supporting restorative practices
- Specific programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures
- Whether restorative justice is central to the school's approach or mentioned peripherally

"Based on the available search results provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of James Stephens Elementary School/Lee County Schools' approach to Restorative Justice as requested.

**Limitation of Available Information**

The search results contain only navigation menus and page headers from the Lee County Schools district website, without the substantive content from the code of conduct pages where restorative practices terms were reportedly found. While the scraped data confirms that the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear across multiple district code of conduct pages (including the Interventions and Corrective Actions, Introduction, Essential Information, Discipline, and main Code of Conduct pages), the actual policy language, program descriptions, implementation details, and philosophical frameworks are not included in the search results.

**What Can Be Confirmed**

The search results do establish that Lee County Schools, the district serving James Stephens Community School, has committed to using restorative practices as part of its discipline approach. This is corroborated by an external source documenting that Lee County Schools signed an agreement with the Lee County NAACP in which the district committed to ""use restorative practices and alternatives to suspension"" as part of broader efforts to address racial equity in discipline.[4] However, the specific details about how James Stephens Elementary implements these practices, what infrastructure exists, how staff are trained, or how the school conceptualizes restorative justice philosophy cannot be determined from the available content.

**Conclusion**

To provide the comprehensive, evidence-based narrative analysis you have requested—addressing restorative justice presence, contextual understanding, philosophy assessment, and infrastructure—the full text content from the district's code of conduct pages would be necessary. The current search results contain only structural elements of the website without substantive policy or program information.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly referenced in the Lee County Schools District Code of Conduct, indicating their inclusion as part of the district's disciplinary framework that encompasses Donna J. Beasley Technical Academy. The term ""alternatives to suspension"" also appears, suggesting a shift toward non-exclusionary methods aligned with restorative principles.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface across six specific pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. On the discipline page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned together, positioning them within discussions of disciplinary responses rather than as standalone program descriptions or mission statements. The scraped content shows these terms embedded in navigation-heavy pages focused on school listings and policy overviews, but without full textual excerpts detailing usage—likely indicating they appear in sections outlining intervention strategies, corrective actions, and progressive discipline models as official policy elements.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Restorative practices appear peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as supportive tools within a broader code of conduct that emphasizes interventions over purely punitive measures. They are not framed as a transformative core philosophy with detailed explanations of repairing harm, stakeholder involvement, or community building, but rather as practical options alongside other strategies, suggesting a pragmatic adoption to reduce suspensions without deep ideological commitment evident in the content.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure is mentioned or evident in the provided content, such as specialized staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs like restorative justice centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments. The absence of these details points to restorative practices being referenced at a high-level policy level without supporting implementation structures described on the pages.

"# Analysis of Palm Acres Charter High School / Lee County Schools' Restorative Justice Approach

Based on the available search results provided, I cannot deliver the comprehensive analysis you have requested. The search results do not contain the specific content from Palm Acres Charter High School or the detailed pages from the Lee County Schools district website that you reference in your query.

The search results provided include general information about Lee County Schools' consideration of restorative practices as district-wide alternatives to suspensions[1], a definition of restorative justice practices[2], and details about a 2017 civil rights settlement agreement between Lee County Schools and the NAACP that commits the district to using restorative practices and alternatives to suspension[3]. However, these results do not contain the specific scraped content from the six pages you identified (the code of conduct pages, interventions and corrective actions pages, discipline pages, etc.) that would be necessary to analyze Palm Acres Charter High School's specific approach.

To provide the structured analysis you have requested—addressing restorative justice presence, contextual understanding, philosophy assessment, and infrastructure—I would need access to the actual content from those specific district website pages where the terms ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" appear.

**What can be confirmed from available results:** Lee County Schools as a district has committed to using restorative practices and alternatives to suspension as part of their discipline approach, particularly following their agreement with the NAACP[3]. However, specific information about how Palm Acres Charter High School implements these practices is not available in the provided search results.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches in school discipline, are explicitly referenced as part of Lee County Schools' framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear. Alternatives to suspension are also noted, aligning with restorative justice goals of reducing exclusionary discipline.[1][2]

These terms surface across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). They appear in official policy contexts related to student behavior management, such as discipline procedures and corrective strategies, rather than mission statements, staff listings, or casual mentions. For instance, on the Discipline and Interventions pages, restorative practices are positioned alongside alternatives to suspension as structured responses to misconduct, indicating their role in the district's formal disciplinary toolkit.

This integration suggests restorative practices form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive, relationship-focused interventions that prioritize repairing harm over punitive measures like suspension—consistent with broader restorative justice tenets of addressing behavior root causes and fostering community accountability.[1][2] However, without detailed descriptions of implementation, such as specific protocols or outcomes, their depth remains peripheral rather than a fully embedded educational pillar.

No infrastructure is evident in the available content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments; the mentions are limited to policy listings without supporting details.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which oversees Northern Palms Charter High School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary framework, though the specific term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the provided content. These related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punishment, but the scraped pages offer only passing mentions without detailed implementation guidance.

**Contextual Understanding**: The terms surface exclusively across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on its website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" On the ""Discipline"" page, both **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are referenced together, likely within discussions of corrective strategies to address student behavior without removal from school. Other pages, such as ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" list **restorative practices** amid broader disciplinary options, positioning them as official policy components rather than casual references, mission statements, or staff descriptions. No substantive excerpts detail their application, as the provided content is dominated by school directories and navigation elements, truncating relevant policy text.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** appear peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as supportive interventions within the Code of Conduct to promote behavioral correction and equity, rather than a core, school-wide ethos like relationship-building circles or peer mediation seen in broader restorative models. This aligns with district commitments to reduce disproportionate discipline—evident in a 2017 NAACP settlement requiring continued use of **restorative practices and alternatives to suspension** alongside training on bias and disparities—suggesting a focus on fairness and retention over punitive measures. However, without elaborated definitions or examples, their role remains conceptual, not deeply embedded in educational practices specific to Northern Palms Charter High School.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments. The terms are mentioned solely in policy contexts without links to implementation structures, indicating reliance on general district protocols rather than specialized supports.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, are referenced across multiple pages of the Lee County Schools district Code of Conduct, indicating their inclusion as part of the district's disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly used. Alternatives to suspension are also noted, aligning with restorative approaches that prioritize non-exclusionary interventions over traditional punishments.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms appear exclusively on six district website pages dedicated to the Code of Conduct, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. On the interventions_and_corrective_actions and discipline pages, **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** are highlighted in sections addressing student behavior management, suggesting their role in official disciplinary policies rather than mission statements, staff listings, or peripheral mentions. No full textual excerpts beyond page titles and term detections are available in the scraped content, limiting precise quoting, but their consistent presence across policy-focused pages implies integration into corrective strategies for handling infractions.

**Philosophy Assessment**: The mentions position **restorative practices** as embedded in the district's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive interventions that support relationship repair and reduced reliance on suspensions, consistent with broader definitions of restorative approaches that emphasize community building over punishment. This integration appears central to the Code of Conduct's structure, spanning introductory, essential, and action-oriented sections, rather than peripheral, though the absence of detailed explanations or examples prevents assessing deeper conceptualization or full philosophical commitment.

**Infrastructure**: No evidence of dedicated infrastructure emerges from the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the terms are referenced only in policy contexts without supporting implementation details.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Tortuga Preserve Elementary School, part of Lee County Schools, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary approach, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned; these related terms signal a partial alignment with restorative principles focused on non-exclusionary responses to student behavior.[1][2]

These terms appear exclusively on the Lee County Schools district website across six pages within the Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" ""Rights and Responsibilities,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page; they are referenced in contexts of official district policies on student discipline, such as interventions, corrective strategies, and progressive discipline models, rather than program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements. For instance, on the ""Discipline"" page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are noted alongside traditional measures, positioning them as proactive options to address misconduct without removing students from learning environments.[1]

The district's philosophy integrates **restorative practices** as a core component of its educational and disciplinary framework, emphasizing equity and reduced reliance on punitive measures like suspensions, as evidenced by a 2017 settlement agreement with the Lee County NAACP that mandates their continued use to promote racial equity and fair discipline; this conceptualizes the practices as tools for reconciliation, bias mitigation, and community building, shifting from exclusionary tactics toward supportive interventions that maintain student engagement.[3] They are not peripheral mentions but embedded in policy language, suggesting a district-wide commitment to restorative-oriented discipline as part of broader goals like diversity, inclusion, and addressing disparities in student outcomes.

No specific infrastructure is detailed in the available content, such as dedicated staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments; the pages provide only high-level policy references without implementation details like training protocols or specialized roles.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of **Restorative Justice**, appear as part of the Lee County Schools district's disciplinary framework, which applies to Athenian Academy Charter School as a district school. The term ""restorative practices"" is explicitly mentioned across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" indicating an intentional shift toward non-punitive interventions rather than full Restorative Justice programs with detailed implementation.

**Contextual Understanding**: These terms surface exclusively on six pages within the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, not on any school-specific site for Athenian Academy. Specifically, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), the Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), and Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline) pages. ""Alternatives to suspension"" appears on the Discipline page. They are embedded in official policy contexts, such as outlining interventions and corrective strategies, rather than mission statements, staff listings, or casual references. However, the scraped content provides no full sentences or detailed explanations around these terms—only navigation menus, school lists, and truncated policy headers—limiting insight into precise usage, such as whether they describe circles, conferences, or mediation.

**Philosophy Assessment**: **Restorative practices** seem peripherally integrated into the district's disciplinary philosophy as an alternative to traditional exclusionary measures like suspension, aligning with broader educational trends favoring reconciliation over punishment. The consistent placement across Code of Conduct pages suggests they form part of a structured approach to student behavior management, conceptualized as proactive interventions to maintain school community health. Yet, without elaborated definitions, examples, or connections to outcomes like reduced suspensions, their depth remains unclear; they are not framed as a transformative philosophy akin to comprehensive Restorative Justice models seen elsewhere.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure is evident in the available content. There are no mentions of dedicated staff (e.g., restorative coordinators), specific programs (e.g., harm-repair circles or justice centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures supporting these practices. The terms stand alone without supporting details on implementation.

However, the scraped content provides no contextual explanations, definitions, or usage examples beyond the bare term occurrences; the pages primarily list school directories, navigation menus, and partial district information, with terms embedded amid incomplete text like school names and login prompts, suggesting they are passing mentions rather than detailed official policies, program descriptions, or mission statements.[1]

The content does not indicate that **restorative justice** forms part of the facility's philosophy or is integrated into its educational or disciplinary approach; the mentions are peripheral and lack any conceptualization, such as descriptions of practices, goals, or applications specific to the detention center. No evidence shows how the district interprets these terms, and they do not connect to broader restorative principles like victim-offender mediation or harm repair.

No infrastructure is evident, including dedicated staff positions, named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures related to restorative justice or the mentioned terms; the content reveals nothing beyond the terms themselves.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly part of Lee County Acceleration Academies' approach, as the term ""Restorative Justice"" does not appear in the available content; however, related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned on the district website.**

These terms surface exclusively on six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section, including interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page, as well as rights_and_responsibilities. The scraped content shows ""restorative practices"" listed repeatedly across these pages, often in navigational or policy contexts alongside school listings and district menus, while ""alternatives to suspension"" appears specifically on the discipline page. No detailed explanations, examples, or implementations are provided in the excerpts; the terms seem integrated into official policy frameworks as corrective strategies, likely as part of broader discipline interventions, but without substantive descriptions or passing mentions beyond their identification.

The content does not indicate that restorative practices form a core part of the district's—or by extension, Lee County Acceleration Academies'—philosophy. They appear peripherally within the Code of Conduct structure, without evidence of deep integration into educational approaches, mission statements, or program descriptions. No specific conceptualization is offered, such as definitions tying restorative practices to relationship-building, accountability, or alternatives to punitive measures; the mentions lack context on how they are applied, suggesting they are policy keywords rather than a defined philosophy.

No infrastructure supports these terms. The content reveals no dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators or facilitators, no named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, no training initiatives, and no organizational structures or departments linked to restorative practices or alternatives to suspension. Lee County Acceleration Academies, as a district partner focused on flexible blended learning, academic coaching, and social-emotional support for disengaged students, shows no connection to these terms in the provided materials.

"**Restorative Justice is not explicitly mentioned in the available content from the Lee County Schools district website, which oversees Bonita Springs High School; however, the related term ""restorative practices"" appears repeatedly across multiple pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting a partial alignment with restorative approaches as non-punitive disciplinary options.[1][2][3][4][5]**

These terms surface exclusively on six district website pages dedicated to the Code of Conduct—specifically, /interventions_and_corrective_actions, /introduction, /essential_information, /discipline, the main /code_of_conduct page, and /rights_and_responsibilities—without any occurrences on the Bonita Springs High School site itself. In these contexts, ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are referenced in sections addressing student discipline, interventions, and corrective actions, positioning them as official components of the district's policy framework rather than casual mentions, program descriptions, staff roles, or mission statements. For instance, the /interventions_and_corrective_actions and /discipline pages highlight them amid discussions of school-wide disciplinary strategies, implying their use to address misconduct without detailing specific applications or examples beyond navigation and header elements.

This usage indicates that restorative practices form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, integrated into the broader Code of Conduct as one tool among traditional interventions, but not as a core or transformative educational approach. The district conceptualizes these practices narrowly as disciplinary alternatives, likely emphasizing relationship repair and reduced exclusions over punishment, though the scraped content provides no elaboration on their meaning, implementation steps, or philosophical underpinnings, preventing a deeper assessment of centrality to school culture.

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments; the mentions remain high-level policy references without supporting structures.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The Lee County Schools district, which includes Harns Marsh Middle School, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** as elements of its disciplinary approach, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned in the available content.[1][2][3][4][5]

These terms appear exclusively on six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, and ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They are referenced in the context of official district policies on student discipline and behavior management, positioned alongside school listings that include Harns Marsh Middle School, but without school-specific details or full explanatory text in the scraped content. For instance, ""restorative practices"" is noted on the ""Discipline"" page alongside ""alternatives to suspension,"" suggesting their role within a broader framework of interventions rather than isolated mentions.[1]

This usage indicates that restorative practices form part of the district's disciplinary philosophy, integrated into the Code of Conduct as proactive, non-exclusionary strategies to address misconduct, likely emphasizing relationship repair and accountability over punitive measures like suspension. The district conceptualizes these practices as corrective tools within its student code, aligning with a commitment to equitable discipline, as evidenced by external context from a 2017 NAACP agreement mandating their continued use alongside bias training and data sharing to reduce disparities.[5] However, the content lacks elaboration on specific methods like circles or conferences, limiting insight into deeper philosophical integration.

No infrastructure is detailed in the provided content, such as dedicated staff roles (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the terms appear as policy keywords without supporting implementation details.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative practices, a core component of restorative justice approaches, are explicitly referenced as part of Lee County Schools' disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself does not appear. Alternatives to suspension are also noted alongside these practices, indicating a shift toward non-punitive interventions.

These terms surface repeatedly across six pages of the district's Code of Conduct section on the Lee County Schools website, including ""Interventions and Corrective Actions,"" ""Introduction,"" ""Essential Information,"" ""Discipline,"" and the main ""Code of Conduct"" page, as well as ""Rights and Responsibilities."" They appear in official policy contexts related to student discipline, suggesting integration into district-wide behavioral management rather than school-specific programs, mission statements, or staff listings. For instance, on the ""Discipline"" page, both ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" are mentioned together, implying their use as structured responses to misconduct within the code's guidelines for interventions.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Restorative practices form a peripheral yet official element of the district's disciplinary philosophy, positioned as viable options within a broader code of conduct that lists schools like Amanecer Elementary alongside punitive measures. The content does not elaborate on their conceptualization—such as defining them as relationship-building circles, harm repair conferences, or empathy-focused dialogues, which are common in restorative justice models—nor does it indicate deep philosophical integration into educational goals like school climate improvement or equity. Instead, mentions are brief and functional, likely serving as alternatives to exclusionary actions like suspension, without evidence of a transformative, whole-school restorative approach.

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the available content, including staff positions such as restorative coordinators or facilitators, named programs like restorative centers, training initiatives, or specialized departments. The terms stand alone without supporting details on implementation, such as peer mediation protocols or professional development, limiting insight into practical application at Amanecer Elementary School or district-wide.

Based on the scraped content, meaningful details about implementation, training, or outcomes are absent, preventing a full assessment of how deeply restorative practices shape daily operations.

"I cannot provide the comprehensive analysis you've requested because the search results provided do not contain the specific content from Lee County Schools' website pages that you referenced.

The search results include general information about restorative practices in schools from educational research organizations and the CDC, but they do not include the actual scraped content from the Lee County Schools district website pages you mentioned (the code of conduct pages, discipline policies, interventions and corrective actions, etc.). While your query indicates that terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""alternatives to suspension"" were found on those six district pages, the actual text content from those pages is not included in the search results provided to me.

To complete the analysis you've requested—which requires identifying specific language, context, philosophy, and infrastructure related to restorative justice at Lemuel Teal Middle School/Lee County Schools—I would need the actual content from those district website pages, not just confirmation that the terms appear there.

**What I can tell you:** Based on the general search results provided, restorative practices in schools typically involve reconciliation-focused approaches to discipline that emphasize repairing harm and building relationships rather than punitive measures.[1][2][3][4] However, without access to Lee County Schools' specific policy language and implementation details, I cannot determine how or whether this school/district has integrated these approaches into their actual discipline philosophy and infrastructure.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Gateway High School / Lee, as part of the Lee County Schools district, incorporates **restorative practices** and **alternatives to suspension** into its disciplinary framework, though the term ""Restorative Justice"" itself is not explicitly mentioned. These related terms signal an approach aligned with restorative principles, emphasizing non-exclusionary responses to student behavior over traditional punitive measures.

These terms appear exclusively on the district's Code of Conduct website pages, with no mentions on the Gateway High School site itself. Specifically, **restorative practices** is referenced across six pages: the main Code of Conduct page (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct), Interventions and Corrective Actions (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/interventions_and_corrective_actions), Introduction (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/introduction), Essential Information (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/essential_information), Discipline (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/discipline), and Rights and Responsibilities (https://www.leeschools.net/our_schools/code_of_conduct/rights_and_responsibilities). The term **alternatives to suspension** appears on the Discipline page. However, the scraped content provides only page titles, navigation menus listing schools (including Gateway High School), and standard district elements like staff directories and report cards, without full textual explanations or examples of usage. This suggests the terms are embedded in official district policies on student conduct, likely as part of structured sections outlining disciplinary interventions, rather than in mission statements, program descriptions, or staff listings.

Restorative practices appear to form a peripheral element of the district's disciplinary philosophy rather than a deeply integrated core approach, as they are mentioned alongside broader code of conduct topics without detailed conceptualization or examples in the available content. The district positions these practices within a policy framework that promotes interventions and corrective actions, implying a shift toward relationship-focused, non-punitive strategies for addressing misconduct, but the lack of substantive descriptions prevents assessing how they are specifically defined—such as through circles, conferencing, or harm repair—or their connection to broader educational goals like community building.

No infrastructure is evident in the content, including dedicated staff positions like restorative coordinators, specific programs such as restorative centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments. The mentions remain high-level policy references without implementation details.

"**Restorative Justice is not part of SW FL Addiction Services - The Vince Smith Center / LEE's approach, as no such terms or related concepts appear in the available content from their associated websites.**

The provided content, drawn exclusively from six pages of the Lee County Schools district website under the ""Code of Conduct"" section (specifically: interventions_and_corrective_actions, introduction, essential_information, discipline, and the main code_of_conduct page), mentions **restorative practices** on all six pages and **alternatives to suspension** on one (the discipline page).[1][2][3][4][5][6] However, these mentions are limited to term occurrences without any surrounding explanatory text, examples, definitions, or contextual usage in the scraped excerpts, which primarily consist of school navigation menus, lists of elementary, middle, high, and center schools, and partial district information like staff directories and community programs. The terms appear as isolated keywords rather than integrated into official policies, program descriptions, mission statements, or discipline frameworks; for instance, no details describe how restorative practices are applied, such as through circles, conferences, or relationship-building processes common in educational restorative justice models.[3][5][6] External search results confirm that SW FL Addiction Services - The Vince Smith Center focuses on residential treatment for adolescents aged 13-18 addressing substance abuse and mental health, with no reference to school discipline, restorative approaches, or justice practices.[1][2][4]

This lack of substantive content prevents assessing whether restorative justice forms part of the center's philosophy or educational approach; the terms' presence on district code of conduct pages suggests a peripheral district-level acknowledgment, possibly as aspirational alternatives to punitive measures like suspension, but they are not conceptualized, exemplified, or linked to the Vince Smith Center's addiction treatment mission. No evidence indicates integration into daily operations, such as restorative chats, norm-setting, or multitiered supports seen in broader restorative practices literature.[3][5][6]

No infrastructure is evident for restorative justice or related terms at the school or district level. The content identifies no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., restorative centers or character academies), training initiatives, or organizational structures; school lists and menus dominate without mentioning such elements.

"# Whispering Winds Charter School: Restorative Justice and Discipline Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Whispering Winds Charter School does not explicitly employ the terminology of ""Restorative Justice"" or ""restorative practices"" in its publicly available web content. However, the school does implement a **non-punitive discipline system** that shares philosophical alignment with restorative approaches, though it is not formally branded or identified as such.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""non-punitive discipline"" appears on the school's ""Our History & Philosophy"" page, which serves as the primary articulation of the school's educational approach and foundational beliefs. This page is a core institutional document that outlines the school's mission, target population, and pedagogical methods. The non-punitive discipline system is presented as an integral component of the school's overall educational philosophy, positioned alongside other defining characteristics such as the inclusionary model, small class sizes, and research-based instructional methods.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Whispering Winds conceptualizes discipline through a developmental and community-centered lens rather than a punitive one. According to the school's philosophy statement, the non-punitive discipline system ""focuses on developing in each child a sense of responsibility and community,"" with children learning ""from the natural consequences of his or her own behaviors.""[5] This approach reflects principles consistent with restorative justice—emphasizing accountability through understanding consequences, community building, and personal growth—though the school does not use the formal restorative justice terminology. The philosophy further emphasizes that the school ""build[s] classroom communities where children develop meaningful positive relationships with their teachers and the other students in the classroom,""[5] which aligns with the relational foundation of restorative approaches. The non-punitive system appears to be a deliberate philosophical choice rooted in the school's founding mission to serve individual student needs in a ""family style setting.""

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not identify dedicated staff positions, specialized programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures specifically designated for restorative justice or non-punitive discipline implementation. No coordinators, facilitators, specialists, or alternative programs are mentioned in relation to this discipline approach.

"# Sigsbee Charter School / Monroe: Restorative Justice Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice is explicitly integrated into Sigsbee Charter School's disciplinary framework and is identified as a core component of the school's behavior management system. The school does not treat restorative justice as a peripheral or supplementary approach; rather, it is positioned as a foundational element of their Code of Conduct alongside the ""Discipline with Dignity"" philosophy.

**Contextual Understanding**

Restorative Justice appears on the school's behavior policy page (https://www.sigsbee.org/families/handbook-policies/behavior), which serves as the primary source for the school's discipline and conduct guidelines. The term is introduced in the opening description of the school's behavior plan, where the Code of Conduct is explicitly described as ""a system of Restorative Justice.""[3] The concept is further reinforced in the principles section, where stakeholders are instructed to ""maintain a culture of empathy and responsibility using restorative justice"" and to ""focus on positive action and conflict resolution rather than on accusation or finger-pointing.""[3] This placement within official policy documentation indicates that restorative justice is not a passing mention but rather an intentional, documented approach to school discipline.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice appears to be deeply integrated into Sigsbee Charter School's educational philosophy rather than mentioned peripherally. The school conceptualizes restorative justice within a broader framework that emphasizes teaching responsible decision-making, logical consequences, and long-term behavioral change. The school's approach is grounded in the principle that ""discipline works best when integrated with effective teaching and modeling"" and that ""the goal of the Code of Conduct is long-term behavioral change, not quick fixes.""[3] This philosophical alignment suggests that restorative justice is understood not merely as a disciplinary tool but as part of a comprehensive approach to developing student responsibility and community accountability. The emphasis on empathy, respect, and dignity throughout the behavior plan indicates that restorative justice serves as a mechanism for building relationships and fostering a positive school culture rather than simply addressing misconduct.

**Infrastructure**

Based on the available content from the school's website, specific infrastructure dedicated to restorative justice—such as dedicated staff positions with titles like ""Restorative Justice Coordinator"" or ""Restorative Practices Facilitator,"" formal restorative justice centers, or specialized training programs—is not explicitly described. The school does employ ""a licensed school counselor onsite as well as a behavior specialist,""[2] and these roles may incorporate restorative practices, but the content does not provide sufficient detail to confirm whether these positions are specifically designated for restorative justice implementation or how they operationalize restorative approaches in practice.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at William Frangus Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that William Frangus Elementary has implemented these practices at the school level. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the school's individual website.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues.[1] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it within the district's broader climate and culture framework.[1] The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most substantive description, framing restorative practices as a comprehensive framework within the district's educational approach.[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative practices represent a deliberate philosophical shift within OCPS toward addressing underlying causes of student misbehavior rather than relying solely on punitive measures. According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, **restorative practices are designed to cultivate positive and supportive school environments** by prioritizing strong relationships among all school community members.[3] The district emphasizes that these practices aim to **significantly decrease school suspensions** related to infractions such as disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] A core principle is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing conflicts through open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, which enhances personal responsibility and empowers individuals to initiate positive change.[3] This philosophy reflects a commitment to building community and teaching interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills as preventative measures against future conflicts.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the coordinating body for these initiatives and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative under this department's purview, alongside other climate and culture programs such as mentoring, school support systems, and vape prevention.[1] The district has also created specialized positions, including Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists who develop, plan, and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs for at-risk youth, conduct restorative circles, and collaborate with administration on comprehensive wellness programs.[4] Additionally, OCPS has partnered with external law enforcement agencies through its Civil Citation program, which identifies troubled students for counseling interventions rather than traditional criminal justice processing.[1]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Shingle Creek Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the school level is not detailed in the available content.[2][1]** 

Restorative Justice appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page, described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, Restorative Practices is mentioned on the Access and Opportunity department page as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] It also surfaces peripherally in the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside related efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention, and in a Stellar Award finalist profile for a behavior specialist at another elementary school, though without direct linkage to practices.[1][2] These references frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements or staff listings.

This presence suggests Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, resilience, and alternatives to punitive discipline rather than standalone policies.[2] They align with broader initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance, indicating an integrated approach to positive school climates over peripheral mentions.[2] However, the content provides limited depth on conceptualization, focusing more on goals like suspension reduction and community dialogue than detailed methodologies.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or school-specific structures; the terms are housed under the Access and Opportunity department without mentions of implementation supports like those seen in external Orange County programs.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Piedmont Lakes Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though specific implementation at Piedmont Lakes Middle School is not detailed in the available content.[3]

The terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Piedmont Lakes Middle school site. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, signaling its place in school support systems, and receive detailed explanation on the Access and Opportunity home page as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] A passing reference occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page, likely in a departmental context amid behavior specialist profiles, but without elaboration.[2] These uses frame the terms in official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad policies, mission statements, or staff awards.

This indicates restorative practices form a philosophical cornerstone of OCPS's Access and Opportunity department, which seeks to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures, explicitly linking the approach to reduced suspensions, community-building, and skill development in empathy and problem-solving.[3] Restorative justice, meanwhile, is conceptualized more narrowly as a diversionary counseling intervention for disciplinary issues via law enforcement partnerships, suggesting a practical tool for addressing behavioral roots rather than a district-wide ethos.[1] The district portrays these as proactive strategies for resilience and collaboration, aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring that emphasize traits such as self-awareness, grit, and responsible decision-making, though they remain somewhat peripheral without evidence of school-specific mandates or universal adoption.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, centers, or organizational units explicitly tied to these terms; restorative practices are listed under Access and Opportunity without staff titles or program specifics beyond general descriptions, and restorative justice references a partnership without internal roles.[1][3] Mentoring and related supports exist within Access and Opportunity, but they are not directly linked to restorative methods.[3]

"# Restorative Justice at Orange County Public Schools: Comprehensive Analysis

## Restorative Justice Presence

**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are clearly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school climate.** The terms appear across multiple official district web pages and are integrated into the district's formal educational framework, indicating institutional commitment rather than peripheral mention.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four distinct OCPS district pages, each serving a different functional purpose. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[6] This positioning establishes restorative justice as an official, collaborative program with law enforcement integration.

The most substantive content appears on the Access and Opportunity page, which houses the district's restorative practices initiative under a dedicated section titled ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions.""[3] This placement within the Access and Opportunity department—a unit explicitly committed to ""narrowing achievement gaps by fostering an environment conducive to learning""—demonstrates that restorative practices are embedded within the district's broader equity and school climate infrastructure. The site map further confirms this institutional integration by listing ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department.[1]

## Philosophy Assessment

Based on the available content, restorative practices represent a **core philosophical shift in how OCPS approaches student discipline and school culture.** The district conceptualizes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3]

The philosophy centers on several key principles: ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts,"" facilitating ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" and enhancing ""personal responsibility"" while empowering ""individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Notably, the district specifically targets ""disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" as key infractions where restorative practices aim to ""significantly decrease school suspensions.""[3] This represents a deliberate departure from purely punitive discipline toward addressing underlying causes and building community.

The integration of restorative justice with the Civil Citation program further reflects a philosophy that seeks to ""identify troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem"" rather than relying solely on exclusionary discipline.[6] This approach aligns with broader district values around resilience-building and mentorship, as evidenced by the district's emphasis on developing traits such as empathy, responsible decision-making, and citizenship through its mentoring initiatives.

## Infrastructure

The available content does not provide detailed information about dedicated staff positions, specific program names, or organizational structures directly supporting restorative practices at OCPS. The district does not list specific coordinators, facilitators, or specialists by name on the pages provided. However, the infrastructure is evident in the following ways:

**Departmental Structure**: Restorative practices are housed within the Access and Opportunity department, which operates under the broader student services framework and maintains a physical office at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801, with contact information available (407-317-3200 x 2003470).[3]

**Program Integration**: The Civil Citation program represents a formal infrastructure linking restorative justice to law enforcement partnerships, indicating a coordinated system for identifying and supporting ""troubled students.""[6]

**Scope**: While specific program names and staff positions are not detailed in the provided content, the district's commitment to implementing restorative practices across ""middle and high schools"" suggests systematic infrastructure, though the exact nature of that infrastructure cannot be determined from these pages alone.

"# Memorial Middle School / Orange County Public Schools: Restorative Justice Approach

## Restorative Justice Presence

**Restorative justice is an established component of Memorial Middle School's disciplinary and safety framework**, appearing across both school and district websites as part of their formal approach to student conduct and school safety. The term is referenced in official school documentation and staff role descriptions, indicating it is not a peripheral initiative but rather an integrated element of the school's operational structure.

## Contextual Understanding

Restorative justice appears most prominently on Memorial Middle's Student Services page, where it is explicitly mentioned within the job description of the **SAFE Coordinator (Safety, Awareness, and Family Engagement Coordinator)**[2]. In this context, restorative justice practices are listed alongside bullying prevention programs as key components of the school's safety initiatives. The specific language states that the SAFE Coordinator works to ""implement and oversee school safety protocols, including bullying prevention programs and restorative justice practices, to ensure a secure and respectful atmosphere for all students.""[2]

At the district level, restorative justice is referenced on the Orange County Public Schools Civil Citation page, which describes a partnership between the school district, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department in ""creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] This framing suggests the district conceptualizes restorative justice as a problem-identification and counseling-based intervention model rather than purely a punitive discipline approach.

The term ""restorative practices"" also appears in the district's site map, indicating it is part of the district's broader organizational taxonomy, though the search results do not provide detailed content from that specific page.

## Philosophy Assessment

Based on the available content, restorative justice appears to be integrated into Memorial Middle's philosophy as a **preventative and supportive approach to school discipline** rather than a peripheral mention. The school positions restorative justice within its Student Services department—a department explicitly described as providing ""a comprehensive support system to ensure every student's well-being, safety, and academic success.""[2] This placement suggests the school views restorative justice as part of a holistic student support system rather than as a standalone punitive measure.

The district's characterization of restorative justice as a program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem"" indicates a philosophy centered on understanding root causes of behavior and providing intervention, rather than simply imposing consequences. This aligns with contemporary restorative justice frameworks that emphasize accountability, healing, and behavioral change.

## Infrastructure

The primary infrastructure element identified is the **SAFE Coordinator position**, which explicitly includes responsibility for implementing and overseeing restorative justice practices.[2] This dedicated staff role suggests the school has formalized restorative justice as an operational responsibility rather than treating it as an ad-hoc initiative.

Beyond this specific position, the search results do not provide evidence of additional dedicated infrastructure such as a Restorative Justice Center, specialized facilitator positions, formal training programs, or detailed organizational structures specifically devoted to restorative justice implementation. The district-level Civil Citation program appears to be a collaborative initiative involving law enforcement and school personnel, but the search results do not clarify whether Memorial Middle has specific staff or resources dedicated to this program beyond the SAFE Coordinator role.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Howard Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though they are not presented as a comprehensive, school-wide philosophy across all operations.[2][1 from scraped content]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Howard Middle School site. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated into a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department and OCPS District Police.[1 from scraped content] **Restorative practices**, mentioned twice, appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS, and receive detailed explanation on the Access and Opportunity home page as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2][1 from scraped content] A peripheral reference occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page, listing restorative practices in a behavior specialist's profile without elaboration.[1 from scraped content] These are program descriptions and departmental overviews, not formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

The content positions restorative approaches as supportive tools within a broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department's focus on positive school cultures, resilience-building traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility), and suspension reduction—aligning with OCPS's commitment to collaboration and growth as quoted from Solution Tree. Restorative Justice is conceptualized externally as a law enforcement-linked diversion for troubled youth via counseling, while restorative practices are framed internally as proactive, relationship-centered strategies to empower change and teach conflict skills, suggesting integration into educational support rather than punitive discipline. However, they appear as specific initiatives rather than a core, district-wide philosophy, with limited depth on implementation details.[2][1 from scraped content]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed under Access and Opportunity without specifics on roles, training, or structures, and the Civil Citation page provides only a dashboard link without operational details.[1 from scraped content][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, with Restorative Justice implemented through a specific district-wide program and Restorative Practices integrated into broader initiatives for school climate and discipline.**[1][4]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling rather than traditional disciplinary measures, linking to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which details it as a framework for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect and insubordination, and teaching interpersonal skills; and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which lists it alongside other climate efforts without further elaboration.[1][4] These references frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual mentions.

This content indicates that **Restorative Justice and Practices form a core element of OCPS's philosophy for fostering positive school cultures and alternatives to punitive discipline**, particularly in the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps. Restorative Practices is conceptualized as a proactive, relationship-centered strategy to empower personal responsibility, collaborative problem-solving, and reduced suspensions in middle and high schools, aligning with broader goals like resilience-building through mentoring.[1][4] The Civil Citation program's counseling emphasis suggests Restorative Justice targets root causes of misbehavior, positioning both as integrated tools for climate and culture rather than peripheral ideas.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's inclusion of Restorative Practices in its key initiatives alongside mentoring and MTSS.[1][4] The Civil Citation program implies collaboration with law enforcement but lacks mentions of internal OCPS staffing or structured implementation.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are clearly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school climate. The terms appear across multiple official district web pages and are integrated into formal programs and initiatives rather than mentioned peripherally.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts across the OCPS district website. First, restorative justice is referenced on the Civil Citation page, where OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in ""creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[3] Second, restorative practices appear in the district's site map navigation structure under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, indicating it is an officially recognized initiative within the district's organizational hierarchy.[1] Third, restorative practices are mentioned in the context of the Stellar Award Finalists page, suggesting they are recognized as part of exemplary educational practice within the district. Fourth, and most substantially, restorative practices receive dedicated content on the Access and Opportunity Home page, which serves as the primary resource hub for this initiative.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school climate and student discipline. According to the district's official description, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously ""building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students"" and ""teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.""[3] This indicates that restorative practices are conceptualized not merely as a disciplinary alternative but as a comprehensive cultural framework addressing relationships, accountability, and skill development.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the organizational home for this initiative, with a contact number of 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative within the Access and Opportunity department alongside other major programs such as OCPS Mentoring, indicating they receive comparable institutional priority and resources. Additionally, the district employs Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists who ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles and provide safety and security at school site.""[4] These specialists collaborate with school administration to develop comprehensive wellness programs and connect with community outreach programs to reduce gang violence and risky behaviors. The district also partners with external organizations; OC Human Relations operates a Restorative Schools Program across eight Orange County schools, providing consulting, modeling, training, mentoring, and case management services.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Pine Loch Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no specific mentions occur on the Pine Loch Elementary school website itself.[1][3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district web pages. ""Restorative Justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without direct context in the provided content; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, positioning them as practical tools within broader support structures.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive, relationship-centered strategies to create supportive environments and address misbehavior's underlying causes, aligning with a philosophy of resilience-building and positive school cultures, as evidenced by their placement under Access and Opportunity—a department committed to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive learning via initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3] Restorative practices are not peripheral but integrated into this philosophy, quoted alongside Solution Tree's emphasis on collaborative, learning-oriented cultures where failures become growth opportunities, suggesting a shift from punitive measures toward community-building and conflict resolution to promote healthy interactions and teach interpersonal skills.[3] However, Restorative Justice appears more narrowly as a law enforcement-linked intervention for troubled students, distinct yet complementary to the broader restorative practices framework.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without elaboration on implementation details like staffing or school-specific rollout.[3] The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program implies collaboration with external agencies but lacks evidence of internal district structures like restorative centers or specialized training programs.[1]

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Princeton Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are currently implemented at Princeton Elementary itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on Princeton Elementary's individual school website.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district webpages. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] Restorative practices are referenced on the district's site map as a departmental initiative under the Access and Opportunity division. Most substantially, the Access and Opportunity homepage provides a detailed description of restorative practices as a key initiative, framing them as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" with the goal of ""reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] The practices emphasize ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.""[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the district content, Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices represent a philosophical shift in how OCPS approaches student discipline and school climate. Rather than relying solely on exclusionary measures, the district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive frameworks that address underlying causes of misbehavior through relationship-building and conflict resolution. The philosophy prioritizes personal responsibility, community involvement, and positive behavioral change over punishment. This aligns with broader educational trends toward restorative models, as evidenced by research showing that such practices can reduce school suspensions.[3]

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support these initiatives. Restorative Practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department, which operates from 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[2] The Civil Citation program represents a formalized partnership structure involving the Sheriff's Office and Police Department.[1] However, the available content does not identify dedicated staff positions (such as restorative justice coordinators or facilitators) specifically assigned to Princeton Elementary, nor does it describe school-specific programs or training initiatives at that location.

**Data Limitations**

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine the extent to which Restorative Justice or Restorative Practices are actively implemented at Princeton Elementary as a school site. The information provided reflects district-level policy and infrastructure rather than school-level implementation details.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Orlo Vista Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the individual school level.[2][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Orlo Vista Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated into a broader civil citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appears three times: on the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), in a Stellar Award finalist profile for a behavior specialist at Dillard St. Elementary (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically targeting reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2][1 from scraped pages]

This usage positions restorative approaches as part of the district's philosophy, particularly within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures—echoing quotes on productive school collaboration. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via counseling partnerships, while restorative practices represent a proactive, relationship-centered strategy to foster community, teach conflict-resolution skills, and shift from punitive measures, though it is presented more as a departmental initiative than a district-wide mandate or core mission statement element.[2][1 from scraped pages]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs or centers beyond the Civil Citation/Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational charts linking to Orlo Vista Elementary. Mentions are program-descriptive or navigational rather than indicative of school-specific rollout, with restorative practices tied to broader Access and Opportunity efforts like mentoring but lacking implementation details.[2][1 from scraped pages]

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Edgewater High / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are uniquely implemented at Edgewater High School itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on Edgewater High's individual school website.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district webpages. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a collaborative program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[5] The site map references restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's Access and Opportunity department. The most substantive description appears on the Access and Opportunity homepage, which dedicates a section to ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions.""[2] These references appear in official district infrastructure pages and departmental descriptions rather than in school-specific mission statements or program listings.

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as a comprehensive framework centered on relationship-building and conflict resolution. According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] The district emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[2] The Civil Citation program specifically targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues, suggesting a rehabilitative rather than purely punitive philosophy.[5]

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not provide evidence of dedicated staff positions, specific programs, or organizational structures at Edgewater High related to restorative justice or restorative practices. While OCPS maintains an Access and Opportunity department that oversees restorative practices district-wide, no specific infrastructure, coordinators, or implementation details for Edgewater High are mentioned in the provided materials. The district does reference a Civil Citation program operated in partnership with law enforcement agencies, but this appears to be a district-level initiative rather than a school-specific program.

**Conclusion**

Based on the available content, restorative justice and restorative practices are established components of OCPS's district philosophy and infrastructure, but the specific implementation, staffing, and programs at Edgewater High School cannot be determined from the provided materials. The district has articulated a clear commitment to these approaches at the organizational level, but school-level details are not available in the sources provided.

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department; it targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1 from scraped content]. **Restorative practices** is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside terms like MTSS and Mentoring, and on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[1 from scraped content]. A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), listing it generically without context[1 from scraped content]. These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews, not staff listings, policies, or mission statements.

This suggests **restorative justice and practices are integrated into OCPS's broader educational philosophy**, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments, resilience-building (via 11 traits like empathy and perseverance), and positive school cultures to narrow achievement gaps[1 from scraped content]. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a proactive, counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in collaboration with law enforcement, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building, dialogue, and suspension reduction as tools for community, conflict resolution, and skill development—aligning with initiatives like OCPS Mentoring but not deeply elaborated beyond these descriptions.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices is simply listed as a key initiative without implementation details[1 from scraped content].

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Apopka Middle School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[2][3]**  

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a formal partnership program with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and local Police Department; this initiative targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[3] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a fragmented context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff listings, with no mentions on the Apopka Middle School website itself.[1][2][3]  

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of OCPS's overarching philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement under the Access and Opportunity department**, which emphasizes positive cultures, resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility), and alternatives to traditional discipline. Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and reactive conflict resolution to promote growth and lower suspensions, while Restorative Justice is more narrowly tied to external law enforcement collaborations for serious behavioral issues—indicating intentional integration into the district's educational approach rather than peripheral mentions.[2][3]  

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; they appear embedded within broader efforts like Access and Opportunity and mentoring, with a contact (Christopher Ludwig) listed for resiliency-related inquiries that overlap thematically.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Ocoee Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Ocoee Middle School website itself.[1][3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, not the school site. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, signaling its place in school support structures, and receive detailed explanation on the Access and Opportunity home page as a framework to build positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically reducing suspensions for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] A passing reference occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page, likely in a truncated staff or initiative context amid behavior specialist profiles, but without elaboration.[1] These uses frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements or policies.

The content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures, where restorative practices foster collaboration, resilience, and proactive conflict skills alongside initiatives like mentoring.[3] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based diversion from traditional juvenile justice, emphasizing root-cause intervention over punishment.[1] This aligns with a shift toward supportive, relationship-driven discipline, though mentions remain program-specific rather than district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts beyond the Access and Opportunity department's umbrella, which lists restorative practices among initiatives like MTSS, mentoring, and vape prevention without further implementation details.[3] The Civil Citation integration implies collaborative processes with law enforcement but lacks evidence of school-specific rollout at Ocoee Middle.[1]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements or policies; for instance, Restorative Justice supports an alternative to traditional juvenile citations via counseling, while restorative practices align with initiatives for safe, inclusive environments under the Access and Opportunity department, quoting Solution Tree on productive school cultures.[1 from query][3] The district conceptualizes these as proactive tools for relationship-building, conflict resolution, and resilience, distinct yet complementary—Restorative Justice focuses on external partnerships for troubled youth, and restorative practices emphasize internal school-wide dialogue and reduced exclusions.[3]

Evidence suggests these concepts form part of the district's philosophy for positive climate and equity, integrated into educational support systems like Access and Opportunity's key initiatives alongside mentoring (emphasizing traits like empathy, grit, and perseverance), but they appear more prominently targeted at middle/high schools and behavior interventions rather than elementary-wide mandates.[3][1 from query] No comprehensive policy handbook or strategic plan excerpt confirms district-wide philosophical centrality, limiting assessment of full integration versus peripheral application.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or centers; restorative practices fall under the broader Access and Opportunity department (445 W.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Lakeview Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no school-specific details for Lakeview Middle School are evident from the content.[2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. It identifies ""troubled students"" and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives like Mentoring and PASS; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with no evidence of them on the Lakeview Middle School website itself.

This content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's broader educational philosophy, particularly through the **Access and Opportunity department**, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by fostering safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like climate and culture support, MTSS, and restorative practices alongside mentoring.[2] The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a proactive counseling-based diversion from traditional juvenile justice for at-risk students, while restorative practices emphasize relational, dialogue-driven strategies to prevent conflicts and teach interpersonal skills, aligning with a shift toward resilience-building (e.g., traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance in OCPS Mentoring).[2] However, the references are descriptive rather than deeply philosophical, lacking details on district-wide adoption or outcomes.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation specifics like timelines, training, or school-level rollout.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Lockhart Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[2][1 from scraped content]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lockhart Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under Access and Opportunity, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2][1 from scraped content]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements or policies; for instance, Restorative Justice supports an alternative to traditional juvenile citations via counseling, while restorative practices align with climate and culture efforts under the Access and Opportunity department, emphasizing proactive community-building over punishment.[2][1 from scraped content] The district conceptualizes these as relationship-focused strategies that prioritize dialogue, empathy, and growth to prevent escalation, reflecting a shift toward supportive interventions.[2]

**Restorative Justice** and practices appear integrated into the district's educational philosophy, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps via positive cultures, as evidenced by restorative practices' explicit goal of lowering suspensions and enhancing interpersonal skills.[2] However, mentions are somewhat peripheral—lacking evidence of district-wide mandates, detailed outcomes, or Lockhart Elementary-specific application—suggesting they form part of a broader climate toolkit rather than a core, fully articulated philosophy.[1 from scraped content][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content. There are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership and general restorative practices framework, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers. The Access and Opportunity department oversees related efforts like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making), but restorative elements lack assigned roles or metrics.[2][1 from scraped content] This scarcity limits assessment of practical implementation.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at Union Park Elementary is not detailed in the available content.**

The terms appear exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Union Park Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3]

These references indicate restorative approaches form part of the district's philosophy on school climate and discipline, conceptualized as proactive tools for fostering inclusive environments, collaborative problem-solving, and resilience rather than punitive measures. On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices align with broader goals of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, healthy learning spaces, complementing initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3] The Civil Citation context positions restorative justice as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students, suggesting philosophical integration into disciplinary alternatives.[1] However, the mentions are program-descriptive and navigational rather than embedded in core policies, mission statements, or school-specific plans, appearing peripherally in staff awards and site structures without evidence of district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as named staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), training programs, centers, or organizational departments explicitly tied to these practices; they are listed under the Access and Opportunity department without further details on roles, budgets, or implementation protocols.[3] This limits assessment of practical rollout at Union Park Elementary or district schools.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Zellwood Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on Zellwood Elementary's school website.[3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district web pages. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear in three locations: the site map under departments like Access and Opportunity; the Access and Opportunity home page, which frames them as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and a Stellar Award Finalists page listing them alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS without further detail.[2] These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual references.

The content suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through proactive relationship-building and alternatives to punitive discipline, as seen in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on collaborative problem-solving to promote resilience and healthy interactions.[3] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize community-wide dialogue to prevent conflicts and teach interpersonal skills, indicating district-wide integration into educational strategies like climate and culture management rather than peripheral mentions.[2][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without elaboration on implementation details.[2][3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Dillard Street Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the school level is not detailed.[1][2][5]

These terms appear exclusively on district website pages, not the school site. **Restorative justice** is mentioned on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) highlighting behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo from Dillard Street Elementary, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a framework for positive school cultures.[2][5]

The district conceptualizes these as proactive, relationship-focused strategies rather than punitive measures. **Restorative justice** targets counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while **restorative practices** emphasize building community, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—through dialogue and skill-building.[1][5] At Dillard Street Elementary, the approach ties to staff expertise, as behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's work with autism students and interventions like the Chess Club demonstrates restorative-aligned behavior management, though not explicitly labeled as such beyond her profile.[2]

These elements reflect a district-wide philosophy prioritizing positive cultures, resilience, and inclusive environments over exclusionary discipline, as seen in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps via safe learning spaces and initiatives like OCPS Mentoring (fostering traits such as empathy and perseverance).[5] **Restorative practices** are positioned as core to this, fostering collaboration and growth, suggesting philosophical integration into broader climate efforts rather than peripheral mentions.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed, such as named coordinators, centers, or training programs; terms appear in program overviews and staff recognition without referencing specific positions, facilities, or structured initiatives at Dillard Street Elementary or district-wide.[1][2][5] The Civil Citation program implies operational support through partnerships, and Access and Opportunity lists restorative practices alongside mentoring and MTSS, but lacks evidence of formalized roles or training.[5]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Lake Silver Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Lake Silver Elementary.[1][3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Lake Silver Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where they are framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, reduce suspensions (especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations), foster relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and teach interpersonal skills.[3] These are program descriptions and departmental mentions rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with the Civil Citation page providing the clearest programmatic detail and Access and Opportunity offering philosophical context.[1][3]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive alternatives to punitive discipline, integrated into broader efforts to create safe, inclusive environments and narrow achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement under Access and Opportunity, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience-building, and reduced suspensions in middle and high schools.[3] Restorative practices align with this philosophy by prioritizing dialogue, personal responsibility, and community over exclusionary measures, while restorative justice functions as a specific intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, suggesting a district-wide philosophy that values root-cause counseling and relationship-building, though not deeply embedded across all schools or explicitly at the elementary level like Lake Silver.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices and the Civil Citation program's partnership structure; OCPS Mentoring is mentioned nearby but focuses on resilience traits like grit and empathy without direct restorative links.[3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Dream Lake Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and discipline alternatives, though specific implementation at Dream Lake Elementary is not detailed.[2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address root causes through counseling, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or school-specific content, with no occurrences on the Dream Lake Elementary school website.

This usage suggests restorative justice and practices form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[2] They are conceptualized as proactive, relationship-centered alternatives to traditional discipline—emphasizing counseling for root issues in restorative justice and dialogue-driven growth in restorative practices—rather than punitive measures, aligning with district goals like reducing suspensions and promoting healthy interactions.[2] However, the content portrays these as peripheral or initiative-specific elements, not deeply integrated across all educational approaches or explicitly tied to elementary schools like Dream Lake.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational structures solely for these practices; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity alongside mentoring and MTSS without further details on implementation.[2] The Stellar Award mention of a behavior specialist at another elementary school hints at related expertise but does not confirm restorative-focused roles district-wide.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Silver Pines Academy K-12 Learning Center, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the specific implementation at Silver Pines Academy itself is not detailed in the available content.[2][5]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the school-specific site. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (without direct connection to practices), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where they are framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2] These are presented in program descriptions rather than formal policies, staff listings, or mission statements, serving as promotional overviews of district initiatives.[1][2]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering inclusive, relationship-driven environments that promote personal responsibility, empathy, and proactive conflict resolution, positioning them as alternatives or complements to traditional discipline to lower suspension rates and support student growth.[2][5] This suggests integration into the broader educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, healthy learning climates, though mentions remain somewhat peripheral without evidence of district-wide mandates or deep philosophical embedding.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly identified, such as named coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs; restorative practices are noted as facilitated by ""trained school staff members (administrator, teacher, or counselor)"" using methods like affective statements, restorative questions, community-building circles, and conflict resolution circles, with successful completion serving as an acceptable consequence in lieu of other penalties.[5] The Civil Citation program's Restorative Justice component implies collaboration with law enforcement but lacks details on staffing or structures.[2] External district documents reinforce this staff-led model without specifying positions or dedicated units.[5]

"Based on the available content provided, I cannot deliver a comprehensive analysis of Conway Elementary/Orange's approach to Restorative Justice as requested.

**Restorative Justice Presence**

The search results provided do not contain any information specific to Conway Elementary or its approach to Restorative Justice. While the user query indicates that terms like ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" were found on Orange County Public Schools district webpages, the actual content from those pages—as included in the search results—does not reference Conway Elementary by name or provide school-specific implementation details.

**Contextual Understanding**

The search results show that restorative practices are mentioned on Orange County Public Schools' district-level pages, specifically on the ""Access and Opportunity"" page[4], which describes restorative practices as a district-wide initiative. However, these references appear to be district-level policy and framework descriptions rather than school-specific implementations. The content indicates that Orange County Public Schools has partnered with law enforcement in a ""Restorative Justice"" program[1] and maintains a district department focused on ""Access and Opportunity"" that includes restorative practices as a key initiative[4], but no specific information about Conway Elementary's participation or approach is provided.

**Philosophy Assessment and Infrastructure**

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is part of Conway Elementary's specific philosophy or infrastructure. The search results do not identify dedicated staff positions, programs, or training initiatives at Conway Elementary. While the district appears to support restorative practices at the organizational level, the provided content does not establish how or whether this translates to implementation at the individual school level.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Glenridge Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary and school climate frameworks, though specific implementation at Glenridge Middle School is not detailed in the available content.[1][4]

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This program identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a partial staff context; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive approach to foster positive school cultures.[4] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, with the Access and Opportunity page providing the deepest context: restorative practices prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and aim to reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while building community and interpersonal skills.[4]

This indicates that restorative approaches form part of the district's philosophy for safe, inclusive environments under the Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps through positive school cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree: schools where collaboration, learning from failures, and faculty support prevail.[4] Restorative justice is conceptualized narrowly as a counseling-based diversion for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships,[1] while restorative practices represent a broader educational strategy for proactive conflict resolution and suspension reduction, particularly in middle and high schools like Glenridge Middle.[4] However, the content offers no evidence of deep philosophical integration across the district or school, presenting these as specific tools within larger climate efforts rather than a core transformative approach.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further details on rollout, staffing, or metrics.[4] The Civil Citation page links to a dashboard but lacks program management specifics.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Azalea Park Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide efforts to support student behavior and school climate, though no direct mentions occur on the Azalea Park Elementary school website itself.[3] The term **restorative justice** is explicitly referenced on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[3] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under departments like Access and Opportunity; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3]

These terms reflect an intentional element of OCPS's philosophy, positioned as proactive strategies within the **Access and Opportunity** department's mission to narrow achievement gaps by fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive environments, alongside initiatives like mentoring that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, shifting from punitive measures toward root-cause resolution, while restorative practices are portrayed as a broader relational toolset for community-building and suspension reduction, aligning with quotes on productive school cultures where collaboration and learning from failures are valued.[3] However, the mentions are program-descriptive rather than embedded in core mission statements or policies, suggesting integration into disciplinary and support systems but not as a district-wide overhaul.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these practices; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity without further structural details, and the Civil Citation program references external partners like police departments but no internal OCPS roles.[3] A behavior specialist profile on the Stellar Award page highlights restorative-adjacent interventions for students with autism, but this is not formally linked to district restorative initiatives.[3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Lakemont Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though specific implementation at Lakemont Elementary is not detailed.[3][5]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a district-wide program developed in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department; this initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[3] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[5] These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, policies, or school-specific content.

This usage suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for school climate and discipline, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, harm repair through dialogue, and alternatives to punitive measures like suspensions, aligning with broader goals of inclusive learning environments under the Access and Opportunity department.[5] The Civil Citation program's restorative justice emphasizes counseling over traditional juvenile justice responses,[3] while restorative practices are tied to cultural transformation and skill-building to prevent conflicts,[5] indicating philosophical integration into district strategies for student support rather than peripheral or ad-hoc mentions.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices and related efforts like mentoring.[5] The Civil Citation program implies collaborative structures with law enforcement but lacks mentions of internal OCPS roles or training initiatives.[3]

"# Restorative Justice Approach at College Park Middle / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to school discipline and student support, though the available content does not provide specific information about College Park Middle's individual implementation of these initiatives.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear across multiple OCPS district webpages rather than on a dedicated school page for College Park Middle. The terms appear in the following contexts:

The district's Civil Citation program page describes a partnership between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department in creating a ""Restorative Justice"" program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This represents a formal district initiative linking school discipline to community law enforcement partnerships.

Restorative practices are listed as a key initiative within the district's ""Access and Opportunity"" department, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[4] The practices appear alongside other district priorities such as mentoring, mental health services, and school climate initiatives, suggesting they are integrated into the district's broader educational framework rather than presented as a standalone program.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative practices reflect OCPS's philosophical shift away from purely punitive discipline models. The district describes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] The approach emphasizes ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving"" to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[4] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[4]

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not provide specific information about dedicated staff positions, programs, or training initiatives at College Park Middle or detailed organizational structures supporting restorative practices at the school level. The district maintains an ""Access and Opportunity"" department that oversees restorative practices implementation across schools, but no school-specific coordinators, facilitators, or specialized positions are identified in the provided content.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Pine Hills Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the individual school level is not detailed in the available content.[1][4]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Pine Hills Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a formal partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department; this initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events handled by agencies like the Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures.[4]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering supportive environments and shifting from punitive measures, indicating integration into its broader educational philosophy rather than peripheral mentions. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes proactive intervention through counseling partnerships to resolve underlying student problems, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice pathways.[1] **Restorative practices**, detailed under Access and Opportunity—a department committed to narrowing achievement gaps via safe, inclusive climates—are defined as prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically targeting reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; this extends to building community, teaching interpersonal skills, and enabling positive change.[4] These align with the department's purpose of productive cultures where collaboration and learning from failures support teachers and students, as quoted from Solution Tree.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly described, such as named coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative alongside OCPS Mentoring, PASS, MTSS, and others under Access and Opportunity (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), but without staff titles, program specifics, or structures beyond departmental oversight.[4] The Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice implies operational collaboration with law enforcement but lacks details on internal staffing or training.[1] Overall, while philosophically embedded in district-wide climate and discipline strategies, the content provides limited evidence of concrete implementation mechanisms.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lake Weston Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department; it targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like OCPS District Police.[1] **Restorative practices** appears three times: as a menu item under the Access and Opportunity department on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), briefly in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration, and substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures.[4]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering safe, inclusive environments and shifting from punitive measures, indicating philosophical integration rather than peripheral mentions. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes proactive counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice pathways.[1] **Restorative practices**, under the Access and Opportunity department, prioritize relationship-building, ensuring ""all voices are heard"" in conflict resolution through open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving; this aims to reduce suspensions—specifically for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—in middle and high schools while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[4] These align with broader department goals of narrowing achievement gaps and promoting resilience traits like empathy and responsibility, alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), training programs, centers, or school-specific implementations; mentions remain high-level program descriptions without named roles, budgets, or rollout details.[1][4] The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees restorative practices as a key initiative, suggesting organizational embedding, but lacks evidence of training, facilitators, or metrics beyond suspension reduction goals.[4]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Rock Lake Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Rock Lake Elementary school website itself.[3][1 from query]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district web pages. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from query] **Restorative practices**, mentioned twice, appear in the Access and Opportunity department's homepage as a **comprehensive framework** to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3][4 from query] It is listed alongside other initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS in the site map and Stellar Award Finalists page, but without further detail there.[2 from query][3 from query]

This indicates integration into OCPS's broader educational philosophy, particularly within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive school cultures quoting Solution Tree on collaborative, learning-focused settings.[4 from query] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in lieu of traditional juvenile justice pathways, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building, dialogue, and skill-building to prevent conflicts, positioning both as philosophical shifts toward support over punishment.[1 from query][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is simply one key initiative under Access and Opportunity without elaboration on implementation.[4 from query]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Blankner K-8**

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, with **Restorative Justice** presented as a specific program and **restorative practices** integrated as a key initiative within the district's broader framework for school climate and discipline.[4] These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, not on the Blankner K-8 school site: the Civil Citation page describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, linking to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] The Access and Opportunity department page details **restorative practices** as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future conflicts.[4] The site map lists **restorative practices** under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside climate, culture, MTSS, mentoring, and vape prevention.[1] A Stellar Award Finalists page mentions **restorative practices** peripherally in a staff profile context, but without elaboration.[1]

These references indicate that **Restorative Justice** forms part of the district's philosophy on discipline, shifting from punitive measures toward addressing underlying problems through counseling and civil citations as alternatives to traditional juvenile justice involvement, as evidenced by the explicit program description and law enforcement collaboration.[1] **Restorative practices**, positioned centrally within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps via safe, inclusive environments, reflect a proactive educational philosophy emphasizing collaboration, resilience, and reduced exclusionary discipline, aligning with quotes on productive school cultures where failures become learning experiences.[4] The district conceptualizes these as relationship-focused strategies that empower students and staff, with **restorative practices** explicitly tied to lowering middle and high school suspension rates and building community, suggesting philosophical integration into school-wide climate efforts rather than peripheral mentions.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts explicitly for these terms; **restorative practices** falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), which also houses related efforts like OCPS Mentoring focusing on resilience traits (e.g., self-awareness, grit, empathy), but lacks mentions of implementation details, budgets, or school-specific rollout.[4] The Civil Citation integration implies operational support via district police and external agencies, but without evidence of school-level facilitators or training mandates.[1] Overall, while philosophically embedded, the available content provides limited depth on practical infrastructure, preventing a full assessment of district-wide adoption at schools like Blankner K-8.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Maynard Evans High School site. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices**, mentioned three times, appear in the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS; on the Stellar Award Finalists page in a brief, truncated context amid staff profiles (potentially linked to behavior interventions); and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1 from scraped pages][3 from scraped pages][4 from scraped pages][3]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements or policies, suggesting an intentional but targeted application focused on discipline diversion and climate improvement. The district conceptualizes **Restorative Justice** as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, while **restorative practices** emphasize proactive relationship-building, dialogue, and suspension reduction to foster accountability and skills for healthier interactions.[2 from scraped pages][3]

**Restorative Justice** aligns peripherally with the district's philosophy of positive, productive school cultures—as articulated in Access and Opportunity's purpose statement quoting Solution Tree on collaboration and learning from failures—but lacks evidence of core integration across all schools or as a district-wide mandate. **Restorative practices** appear more philosophically embedded within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, connecting directly to goals like resilience-building via listed traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility).[4 from scraped pages]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content: there are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Englewood Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as part of its disciplinary and school climate approach, though the terms appear in limited, descriptive contexts rather than as a fully detailed, school-wide mandate.[4][1 from query]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Englewood Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from query] **Restorative practices**, mentioned on the site map under Access and Opportunity, a Stellar Award Finalists page, and prominently on the Access and Opportunity home page, are framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and reducing suspensions—especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4][1 from query] These are program descriptions within departmental overviews, not formal policies, staff listings, or mission statements, serving as passing yet purposeful mentions to highlight supportive initiatives.[1 from query][4]

The district conceptualizes these approaches philosophically as proactive alternatives to punitive discipline, emphasizing root-cause counseling (**restorative justice**) and relationship-building to foster responsibility, empathy, and reduced exclusions (**restorative practices**), aligning with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments under Access and Opportunity.[4][1 from query] This suggests integration into the district's educational philosophy, particularly for climate and culture, though primarily for middle/high schools and not explicitly tied to elementary levels like Englewood.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational structures; **restorative practices** falls under the Access and Opportunity department without further details on implementation, staffing, or metrics.[1 from query][4] The Stellar Award mention links it peripherally to a behavior specialist's work at another elementary, but not as formal infrastructure.[1 from query]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though the available content provides limited details on implementation specifics at Catalina Elementary.[1][4]

The terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Catalina Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a formal district program partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative Practices** appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a **comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions**—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4]

This usage positions **Restorative Justice and Practices as integrated into the district's educational philosophy**, emphasizing proactive relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and alternatives to punitive discipline over exclusionary measures. The Civil Citation program treats Restorative Justice as a core diversionary tool for at-risk students, while Access and Opportunity conceptualizes Restorative Practices as essential to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps and promote resilience—aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring.[4] These are not passing mentions but components of official program descriptions and departmental overviews, suggesting philosophical commitment to restorative principles as a shift from traditional discipline.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training programs, centers, or school-level implementations; references remain high-level without named roles, budgets, or metrics beyond general goals like suspension reduction.[1][4] The district's Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees related efforts, including Restorative Practices alongside mentoring, but lacks evidence of specialized structures or Catalina-specific application.

This content suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement under Access and Opportunity, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience-building, and collaboration for student success; however, they appear more peripherally integrated than centrally embedded, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, conflict resolution, and suspension reduction rather than a district-wide overhaul of discipline.[scraped accessopportunity page][3] No evidence indicates they redefine core educational philosophy, and mentions are brief without metrics of success or school-specific application.

The terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lockhart Middle School website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and uses counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[3]. ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under Access and Opportunity, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[3]. These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff assignments.

This indicates restorative approaches form part of the district's philosophy for safe, inclusive environments and achievement gap reduction, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive cultures via relationship-building and proactive conflict skills. Restorative justice is conceptualized externally via law enforcement partnerships for counseling troubled students, while restorative practices are district-defined as relational tools to lower suspensions and promote growth, aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring focused on resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility)[3]. However, the mentions are not deeply integrated into core educational philosophy and appear more as targeted disciplinary alternatives than school-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without implementation details like facilitators or metrics[3].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Sally Ride Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, conflict resolution, and positive school climates, though no direct mentions occur on the Sally Ride Elementary school website itself.[1][3]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a formal partnership program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements, staff listings, or policies, with restorative justice tied to law enforcement collaboration and restorative practices to proactive culture-building.

This content suggests restorative justice forms part of OCPS's philosophy for addressing misbehavior through root-cause intervention over purely punitive measures, while restorative practices reflect a broader commitment to inclusive, relationship-focused environments that support learning and reduce exclusionary discipline. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a counseling-based diversion for at-risk students via civil citations, and restorative practices as a proactive tool for dialogue, community-building, and skill development to prevent conflicts, aligning with the Access and Opportunity department's goal of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, healthy school cultures.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details like staffing or protocols.[1][3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Maitland Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, discipline alternatives, and positive school climates, though specific implementation at Maitland Middle School is not detailed in the available content.[3][1 from query]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Maitland Middle School site. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[1 from query] **Restorative practices**, mentioned three times, appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff recognition context without elaboration, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[1][2][4 from query] There, it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically reducing suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—positioned alongside mentoring and resilience-building efforts.[3][4 from query] These are program descriptions and departmental overviews, not formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive tools for fostering positive cultures and resilience, integrated into broader educational strategies rather than peripheral mentions. Restorative Justice emphasizes counseling over punitive measures for at-risk students, while restorative practices prioritize dialogue, community-building, and skill development to prevent conflicts, aligning with OCPS's Access and Opportunity department goal of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments.[3][1 from query][4 from query] This suggests a philosophical commitment to relationship-centered discipline as part of the district's educational approach, particularly for middle schools like Maitland Middle, though depth of school-specific adoption remains unclear from the content.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, centers, or organizational units explicitly tied to these terms; restorative practices are listed generically under Access and Opportunity initiatives (contact: Christopher Ludwig for mentoring), and Civil Citation links to external dashboards without internal staffing details.[3][1 from query] The content lacks evidence of specialized positions, formal training, or programs beyond these high-level descriptions.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Brookshire Elementary in Orange, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the specific school level.[1][2]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Brookshire Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnered program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Access and Opportunity home page as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, reduce suspensions in middle and high schools, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and promote personal responsibility.[1] A third mention on the Stellar Award Finalists page lacks substantive context, appearing amid staff profiles without direct linkage to practices.[1]

The district conceptualizes these approaches philosophically as proactive alternatives to traditional discipline, emphasizing root-cause counseling (**restorative justice**) and relationship-building to create inclusive, resilient environments (**restorative practices**).[1] They align with broader goals like narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe, healthy school cultures, as stated in the Access and Opportunity department's purpose, quoting Solution Tree on productive cultures that value collaboration and learning from failures.[1] However, the mentions are program descriptions and navigational listings rather than core mission statements or policies, suggesting peripheral rather than fully integrated philosophy, with no evidence of centrality to Brookshire Elementary specifically.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content: there are no named staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., centers or academies), training initiatives, or organizational structures explicitly tied to these terms beyond the Access and Opportunity department's general oversight and the Civil Citation partnership.[1] Trained school staff (administrators, teachers, counselors) are implied for facilitating restorative practices circles, but without specifics.[6 from search]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Dover Shores Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though no direct mentions appear on the school's own website.[1][3]

These terms surface across four district pages without evidence of school-specific implementation at Dover Shores Elementary. On the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), **Restorative Justice** is described as a formal program partnering with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity resources, signaling departmental categorization,[1] and on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief nod to a behavior specialist's work, though without elaboration.[1] The most detailed context is the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing **restorative practices** as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual references, indicating structured disciplinary alternatives over punitive measures.[1][3]

**Restorative Justice** aligns with the district's philosophy as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, emphasizing counseling over traditional juvenile justice pathways.[1] **Restorative practices**, conversely, form a core pillar of the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, explicitly linking to positive cultures, collaboration, and skill-building in interpersonal dynamics.[3] While not elevated to a district-wide mission statement, these concepts are integrated into educational approaches like climate and culture support, suggesting philosophical commitment to relationship-centered discipline rather than peripheral mentions.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content. The Access and Opportunity department oversees **restorative practices** alongside initiatives like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making), but lacks mentions of specific staff roles (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training programs, centers, or organizational units.[3] The Civil Citation page implies operational support through law enforcement dashboards and partnerships, yet provides no evidence of in-house specialists or formal training.[1] A behavior specialist at another elementary school (Dillard St. Elementary) is highlighted for interventions, but this does not connect directly to restorative frameworks or Dover Shores.[1]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive tools for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, aligning with broader Access and Opportunity goals like mentoring programs that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance; however, they appear more as targeted disciplinary alternatives than a fully embedded district-wide philosophy, with mentions confined to program descriptions rather than core mission statements, policies, or school board agendas.[5] Restorative Justice is positioned peripherally as a law enforcement collaboration for civil citations, while restorative practices suggest a philosophical commitment to relational, dialogue-based discipline over punitive measures, though without evidence of universal application across elementary schools like Tangelo Park.[3][5]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice initiative, training details, or organizational departments solely for these practices; restorative practices falls under the general Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like mentoring and MTSS, but lacks elaboration on implementation structures.[5]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though the specific implementation at Mollie Ray Elementary is not detailed, as terms appear exclusively on district pages rather than the school site.[3][1 from scraped content]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a targeted program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped content] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][1 from scraped content] These references position restorative approaches as official program descriptions within district departments, not mere passing mentions, policies, staff listings, or mission statements.

This usage indicates that restorative justice and practices form a **core element of the district's philosophy for positive school climate and discipline**, conceptualized as proactive relationship-building and reactive counseling alternatives to exclusionary measures, aligning with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments under Access and Opportunity. The Civil Citation integration suggests a rehabilitative focus on underlying issues for at-risk students, while restorative practices emphasize community dialogue and skill-building to prevent conflicts, reflecting a shift toward accountability over punishment.[3][1 from scraped content] However, the content provides limited depth on district-wide philosophical integration, with no explicit ties to overarching strategic plans or elementary-level application at Mollie Ray.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for restorative approaches; restorative practices falls under the general Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside mentoring and other climate efforts like PASS and School Support System, but without detailed implementation structures.[1 from scraped content][3]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive alternatives to traditional punishment, emphasizing relationship-building, dialogue, and root-cause intervention over exclusionary discipline, aligning with broader school climate initiatives like mentoring and resiliency traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility).[2] This suggests integration into the district's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, rather than peripheral or one-off mentions.[2] However, the content lacks evidence of school-wide mandates, detailed outcomes, or connections specific to elementary schools like Lovell.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as named staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), specialized programs or centers, training initiatives, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these practices; they appear embedded within broader departments like Access and Opportunity and Civil Citation processes, with examples like behavior specialists at schools (e.g., Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary) potentially supporting related interventions indirectly.[1 from scraped pages][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Spring Lake Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no school-specific implementation is detailed for Spring Lake Elementary.[3][1 from scraped content][2 from scraped content][3 from scraped content]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2 from scraped content] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a generic department context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, particularly in middle and high schools.[1 from scraped content][3 from scraped content][3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with the Civil Citation page providing the most programmatic detail and Access and Opportunity offering philosophical context.[2 from scraped content][3]

This content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's broader educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps through positive cultures, resilience-building, and alternatives to punitive discipline.[3] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing root-cause resolution over traditional penalties,[2 from scraped content] while restorative practices are defined as proactive relationship-building and dialogue-driven methods to foster accountability, reduce suspensions, and teach conflict skills, aligning with initiatives like mentoring that stress traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making.[3] However, the references are peripheral rather than centrally embedded, lacking evidence of district-wide mandates or philosophical primacy in core strategic plans.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation and general restorative practices under Access and Opportunity, training initiatives, or organizational centers; mentions remain high-level without implementation details like staffing or school rollout.[1 from scraped content][2 from scraped content][3 from scraped content] The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees related efforts like mentoring and climate initiatives, but restorative elements appear as one component among others, such as MTSS and vape prevention, without dedicated restorative structures.[1 from scraped content]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at Chickasaw Elementary is not detailed in the available content.** These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Chickasaw Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. ""Restorative practices"" is listed under the Access and Opportunity department's site map and key initiatives, framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[4]. A passing reference also appears in a Stellar Award Finalists page, noting behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo from Dillard Street Elementary, but without linking her work directly to these practices[1].

This presence suggests restorative justice forms part of the district's philosophy for positive discipline and school climate, shifting from punitive measures toward counseling, dialogue, and relationship-building to support student growth and reduce disruptions, as evidenced by its placement in official program descriptions like Civil Citation and Access and Opportunity initiatives[1][4]. However, it appears more as targeted interventions rather than a fully integrated, school-wide educational philosophy, with conceptualization focused on root-cause counseling for troubled youth and proactive conflict skills to lower suspension rates, without explicit ties to Chickasaw Elementary or elementary-level application.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational structures solely for these practices; restorative practices falls under the broader Access and Opportunity department, which also covers mentoring, MTSS, and climate initiatives, but lacks details on implementation at individual schools like Chickasaw Elementary[1][4]. Based on the limited content, it is not possible to determine the depth of integration or specific practices at this school level.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Rolling Hills Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[2] These terms are mentioned on four specific district website pages, not the Rolling Hills Elementary school site: the Civil Citation page describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[1] The Access and Opportunity department page details **restorative practices** as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2] The site map lists restorative practices under Access and Opportunity subpages like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and School Support System, indicating navigational integration.[1] A Stellar Award Finalists page mentions restorative practices peripherally in a staff profile context, without elaboration.[1]

These references position restorative justice and practices as components of OCPS's broader philosophy on positive school environments and discipline reform, conceptualized as proactive, relationship-centered alternatives to punitive measures like suspensions, emphasizing counseling, dialogue, and root-cause intervention over exclusionary tactics.[2] They align with district commitments to safe, inclusive learning, resilience-building (via mentoring and traits like empathy and responsibility), and narrowing achievement gaps, suggesting philosophical integration into educational support systems rather than peripheral or standalone mentions.[2] However, the content portrays them as district-wide strategies, primarily for middle/high schools and troubled students, with no explicit tie to elementary schools like Rolling Hills or core mission statements.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices appear embedded within the Access and Opportunity department's key initiatives alongside mentoring and MTSS, but without detailed implementation structures.[2] The available content provides limited depth, focusing on high-level descriptions without evidence of school-specific rollout, training protocols, or metrics of success.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Lancaster Elementary in Orange, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the specific school level.[3][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lancaster Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated into the Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appears three times: as a menu item on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity; briefly in a Stellar Award finalist profile on https://www.ocps.net/55601_4 (without elaboration); and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][2 from scraped pages]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions rather than broad mission statements or staff listings, suggesting an operational role in discipline alternatives and school climate initiatives under the district's Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments.[3] The Civil Citation context ties **Restorative Justice** to law enforcement partnerships for non-punitive interventions, while **restorative practices** aligns with proactive culture-building, though no connections to Lancaster Elementary are specified.[1 from scraped pages][3]

**Restorative Justice** appears peripherally as a targeted partnership program rather than a core philosophical pillar, conceptualized as counseling-focused intervention for at-risk students to prevent juvenile justice involvement. In contrast, **restorative practices** shows stronger philosophical integration within the Access and Opportunity framework, emphasizing relationship-building, dialogue, and suspension reduction as means to teach interpersonal skills and community—echoing district commitments to resilience traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance via mentoring.[3] However, without evidence of district-wide policy mandates, training mandates, or school-specific adoption, it remains more descriptive than deeply embedded in everyday educational philosophy.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content. There are no mentions of staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; **restorative practices** falls under the broader Access and Opportunity department, contactable via general channels like Christopher Ludwig for mentoring, but lacks specifics on restorative roles.[3] The Stellar Award nod to a behavior specialist at another elementary school (Dillard St.) highlights interventions but does not link to restorative terms.[2 from scraped pages] Overall, the content offers programmatic glimpses without robust implementation details, limiting assessment of scale or efficacy at Lancaster Elementary.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Bonneville Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices**, mentioned on the site map, Access and Opportunity page, and a Stellar Award Finalists page, are framed as a key initiative under the district's Access and Opportunity department.

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff profiles; for instance, restorative practices is listed alongside efforts like mentoring and school support systems on the Access and Opportunity page, while the Civil Citation page treats Restorative Justice as a diversionary counseling intervention linked to law enforcement.[1 from scraped pages][2 from scraped pages]

**Restorative Justice** appears peripherally as a targeted partnership for juvenile diversion, conceptualized as counseling to uncover problem roots among troubled students, but lacks evidence of district-wide philosophical integration.[1 from scraped pages] In contrast, **restorative practices** aligns more centrally with the district's philosophy of creating safe, inclusive environments to narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's purpose of fostering positive, productive school cultures through collaboration and support—echoed in quotes emphasizing collective improvement and resilience.[2 from scraped pages] It is positioned as proactive for relationship-building and conflict skills, suggesting conceptual alignment with broader goals like resiliency education mandated by Florida statutes, though not explicitly tied to elementary schools like Bonneville.[7 from search]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content. There are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs or centers (beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership), training initiatives, or organizational structures solely for these practices; restorative practices is simply one ""key initiative"" under Access and Opportunity, with contact via a general phone line, and no implementation details like training or case management are provided.[2 from scraped pages] The Stellar Award Finalists page notes a behavior specialist at another elementary school but does not connect her work to restorative approaches.[3 from scraped pages]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), Roberto Clemente Middle School District**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary and school climate programs, though no specific mentions tie them directly to Roberto Clemente Middle School itself.[1][2][5]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a formal partnership program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem."" This positions it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like the Orange County Sheriff's Office and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears twice: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under the Access and Opportunity department's menu, and in detail on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment,"" emphasizing relationship-building, ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts,"" fostering personal responsibility, and specifically aiming to reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations. These are program descriptions rather than passing mentions, policies, or staff listings, with restorative practices linked to broader efforts like fostering resilience through mentorship.[2][5]

This content suggests restorative justice and practices form elements of the district's philosophy on school climate and discipline, shifting from punitive measures toward root-cause counseling and proactive relationship-building to create ""positive, productive school cultures"" where collaboration and learning from failures are prioritized, as quoted from Solution Tree on the Access and Opportunity page. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a partnership-driven intervention for troubled students, while restorative practices represent a district-wide framework integrated into educational approaches for safer, inclusive environments, particularly in middle schools like Roberto Clemente.[2][5] However, the mentions are peripheral rather than central to a district-wide mission statement, lacking evidence of full philosophical embedding across all schools.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content. There are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs or centers beyond the general Civil Citation/Restorative Justice partnership and Access and Opportunity initiatives, training programs, or organizational structures like departments solely for these practices. The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees restorative practices alongside mentoring and other climate efforts, but details on implementation, such as training or school-specific rollout at Roberto Clemente Middle, are absent.[2][5]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though specific implementation at Michael McCoy Elementary is not detailed in the available content.[2][4]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page, described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated into a broader civil citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity (listing it alongside initiatives like classroom management and MTSS), a Stellar Award finalist profile (noting behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's work at Dillard St. Elementary, though without direct linkage), and the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1][4] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with no occurrences on the Michael McCoy Elementary school website itself.

This content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by fostering safe, inclusive environments through relationship-building and proactive conflict skills training.[4] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, while restorative practices emphasize school-wide culture change to minimize punitive discipline, aligning with resilience-building traits like empathy and responsible decision-making promoted in OCPS Mentoring.[4] However, the references are descriptive rather than deeply philosophical, suggesting peripheral rather than core integration, with a focus on outcomes like lower suspensions over comprehensive transformation.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), but without details on roles like those in external models (e.g., RP Coordinators).[4] Similarly, no school-specific implementation at Michael McCoy Elementary is mentioned.

""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3]

This usage positions restorative approaches as components of official district programs rather than passing mentions or staff listings, aligning with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments and positive school climates under the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes narrowing achievement gaps through collaboration and resilience-building.[3] The Civil Citation integration suggests a philosophy linking restorative justice to diversion from traditional juvenile justice, focusing on counseling over punishment,[1] while restorative practices are conceptualized as proactive relationship-building and reactive conflict resolution to foster accountability and prevent suspensions, reflecting a commitment to productive cultures where failures are learning opportunities.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is simply listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention, without implementation details.[3] This indicates peripheral rather than deeply integrated adoption into the district's educational philosophy, with insufficient content to assess school-level application at Robinswood Middle or full operational depth.

"# Union Park Middle / Orange County Public Schools: Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Analysis

## Restorative Justice Presence

**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are integrated components of Union Park Middle School and Orange County Public Schools' disciplinary and school culture framework.** Both terms appear across the school and district websites, indicating an established commitment to these approaches rather than peripheral mention.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms appear in distinct contexts across multiple pages. At the school level, Union Park Middle's Student Services page references **""Restorative Practices""** as part of their ""Behavior Intervention Differentiators,"" describing them as approaches that shift ""from punitive measures to restorative approaches that focus on repairing harm, building [community].""[3] This positioning within the Student Services department indicates integration into the school's formal support structure.

At the district level, **Restorative Practices** appear on the Access and Opportunity Home page, which serves as the district's central hub for school culture and climate initiatives.[1] The district also maintains a dedicated Civil Citation page that explicitly addresses **Restorative Justice** as a formal program, describing it as a partnership between the Orange County School District, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department designed to ""identify troubled students and use counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] Additionally, Restorative Practices are listed on the district's site map under the Access and Opportunity department, confirming their status as an official district initiative.[7]

## Philosophy Assessment

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical shift within the district's approach to discipline and school culture. The district defines **Restorative Practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment""** that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[1] The framework emphasizes ensuring ""that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[1]

The district specifically targets **reducing suspensions related to disrespect, insubordination, and altercations** through these practices.[1] Beyond conflict resolution, the framework is conceptualized as actively building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students while teaching ""essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills"" to proactively reduce future conflicts.[1] This philosophy aligns with Union Park Middle's broader Student Services approach, which emphasizes crisis intervention, conflict resolution, and behavioral interventions delivered through a Multitiered System of Supports (MTSS).[3]

## Infrastructure

Union Park Middle School has embedded Restorative Practices within its Student Services Department structure. The school employs a **School Based Social Worker** (Alyssa Casey) and a **SAFE Coordinator** (Giselle Rackley) who support the implementation of behavioral interventions and positive behavior support.[3] While these positions are not exclusively dedicated to Restorative Practices, they operate within a framework that incorporates restorative approaches as part of their behavioral intervention differentiators.

At the district level, **Restorative Practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department**, which is responsible for narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[1] The district also operates a **Restorative Justice program** in partnership with law enforcement agencies, supported by a Civil Citation Dashboard that tracks school-based cases and coordinates between the Orange County School District Police, Orlando Police Department, and Orange County Sheriff's Office.[2] The district's organizational structure includes dedicated staff within the Access and Opportunity department to oversee these initiatives, though specific coordinator titles for Restorative Practices are not detailed in the available content.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), Pershing School / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no specific mentions occur on the Pershing School website itself.[1][4]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (amid profiles of educators like behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo, without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, framed as a framework for building positive school cultures.[1][4] Contexts range from program descriptions (Civil Citation's restorative counseling) to departmental overviews (Access and Opportunity's emphasis on conflict resolution), positioning them as official district strategies rather than casual references or staff bios.

This usage suggests restorative approaches form a meaningful, if not centrally dominant, element of OCPS's philosophy on school climate and discipline. The district conceptualizes **Restorative Justice** as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, emphasizing root-cause counseling over punitive measures.[1] **Restorative practices**, detailed more comprehensively, prioritize relationship-building, inclusive dialogue, personal responsibility, and collaborative problem-solving to reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while fostering community and interpersonal skills to prevent future conflicts.[4] These align with broader Access and Opportunity goals of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, quoted alongside Solution Tree's vision of productive, collaborative school cultures.[4] Integration appears philosophical yet practical, supporting positive behavior alongside initiatives like mentoring and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), though not elevated to a district-wide mission statement.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content. The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees restorative practices alongside efforts like OCPS Mentoring (focusing on resilience traits such as self-awareness, grit, and empathy) and newsletters on climate, classroom management, and vape prevention, but lacks mentions of specific staff roles (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training programs, centers, or organizational units.[4] The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program references external partners (Sheriff's Office, Police Department) and a dashboard but provides no internal OCPS staffing or training details.[1] Stellar Award mentions of behavior specialists like Lauren Fiallo highlight related expertise in interventions for aggressive behaviors, yet without explicit restorative ties.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Westridge Middle School, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.[3][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Westridge Middle School site itself. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a framework for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][2 from scraped pages]

This usage positions restorative approaches as part of the district's philosophy for fostering positive school cultures, aligning with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments and resilience-building, as seen in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on narrowing achievement gaps through climate initiatives like mentoring and PASS (Positive Alternatives to Student Suspension).[3] However, the mentions are primarily programmatic descriptions and listings rather than core mission statements or detailed policies, suggesting peripheral rather than fully integrated centrality; restorative practices are conceptualized as proactive tools for community-building and suspension reduction, while restorative justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk youth in a law enforcement partnership context.[1 from scraped pages][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units; restorative practices is listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring and Vape Prevention, but without implementation details like staffing or training protocols.[2 from scraped pages][3] The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program implies some operational support via district-police collaboration, including dashboard tracking, but lacks specifics on school-level rollout at Westridge Middle or elsewhere.[1 from scraped pages] Overall, the content offers a high-level endorsement without sufficient detail to assess comprehensive adoption or effectiveness.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Judson B. Walker Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are explicitly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as established district initiatives focused on addressing student behavior through counseling, relationship-building, and conflict resolution rather than traditional punishment.[2] These terms are mentioned on four specific district website pages: the Civil Citation page describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and uses counseling to address root causes of problems, linking to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based civil citations.[1] The Access and Opportunity department page provides the most detailed explanation of **restorative practices**, portraying them as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—in middle and high schools.[2] The site map lists **restorative practices** under the Access and Opportunity section alongside related efforts like mentoring and school climate initiatives.[1] A Stellar Award Finalists page mentions **restorative practices** peripherally in a department context but without elaboration.[1]

These concepts appear integrated into OCPS's core philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[2] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing root-cause counseling over punitive measures.[1] Restorative practices are framed more broadly as a relationship-centered strategy that promotes dialogue, community-building, and skill development to prevent conflicts, aligning with district-wide goals like resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility) and suspension reduction.[2] This suggests a philosophical shift toward restorative over exclusionary discipline, though not as a full replacement, given the civil citation context.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the general Restorative Justice partnership and restorative practices framework, training initiatives, or organizational centers; mentions are limited to departmental overviews and program descriptions without implementation specifics like staffing or training protocols.[1][2] The Access and Opportunity department oversees restorative practices alongside mentoring and climate efforts, with a contact (Christopher Ludwig) listed for related resilience initiatives, but no restorative-specific roles are named.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Winegard Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Winegard Elementary school website itself.[1][4]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation process for school-based events, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses rather than a broad policy or mission statement.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills proactively.[4]

This indicates **restorative practices** forms a core element of OCPS's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support productive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building. Restorative justice aligns peripherally as a justice-oriented extension for disciplinary diversion, emphasizing counseling over punishment, but both terms reflect a shift toward relationship-focused, non-exclusionary strategies rather than punitive measures. They are conceptualized district-wide as tools for conflict resolution, community-building, and behavioral growth, with restorative practices explicitly tied to lowering suspension rates and enhancing educator-student interactions.[1][4]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices alongside initiatives like mentoring and MTSS. The Civil Citation program implies partnerships with law enforcement but lacks mentions of internal OCPS staffing or formal training. A behavior specialist at Dillard Street Elementary (unrelated to Winegard) is highlighted for interventions, but this does not connect directly to restorative approaches.[1][4]

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Lake Sybelia Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that Lake Sybelia Elementary has implemented these practices at the school level. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the school's individual website.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues.[3] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it within the district's broader climate and culture framework.[1] The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most substantive description, dedicating a section to ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions"" as part of the district's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as **a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate positive and supportive school environments** rather than as a punitive discipline system.[3] The district's philosophy emphasizes relationship-building and conflict resolution as central to reducing suspensions, particularly in middle and high schools. According to the district's stated approach, restorative practices prioritize ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing conflicts, facilitate open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, and enhance personal responsibility while empowering individuals to initiate positive change and growth.[3] This philosophy reflects a shift away from exclusionary discipline toward reconciliation and community engagement. The Civil Citation program further demonstrates this philosophy by positioning counseling and root-cause analysis as alternatives to traditional punitive responses.

**Infrastructure**

The available content identifies restorative practices as an organizational initiative housed within the Access and Opportunity department at the district level, but does not provide specific information about dedicated staff positions, specialized programs, or training infrastructure at Lake Sybelia Elementary. The district maintains a broader Access and Opportunity office located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando with contact information (407-317-3200 x 2003470), suggesting centralized coordination of these initiatives across the district.[3] However, the scraped content does not reveal whether Lake Sybelia Elementary has assigned restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists, nor does it describe school-specific programs or training initiatives at this location.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs rather than a school-wide philosophy at Windermere Elementary.** These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, with no references on the Windermere Elementary school website. Specifically, **restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[scraped content from https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation]. **Restorative practices** appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award Finalists page listing a behavior specialist (without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where they are framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[scraped content from https://www.ocps.net/site_map; https://www.ocps.net/55601_4; https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity].

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews, such as Civil Citation for justice-oriented interventions and Access and Opportunity for practices-focused climate improvement, rather than in policies, mission statements, or staff profiles. **Restorative justice and practices appear peripherally integrated into OCPS's broader educational approach, conceptualized as proactive tools for student support, conflict resolution, and discipline alternatives, but not as a core philosophical pillar.** The Civil Citation program treats restorative justice as a counseling-based diversion for troubled youth in collaboration with law enforcement, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building and suspension reduction to promote healthy interactions and skills, aligning with initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which builds resilience traits such as empathy and responsibility[scraped content from https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, including staff positions like coordinators or specialists, named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational structures explicitly tied to these terms; they are referenced as departmental elements under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation at Windermere Elementary or district-wide rollout[scraped content across all four pages]. **Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine the depth of integration or specific application at Windermere Elementary, as terms appear only in district contexts without school-level evidence.**

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, particularly within initiatives aimed at improving school climate, reducing suspensions, and supporting at-risk students, though no specific mentions appear on the Meadowbrook Middle School website itself.[2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a partial staff context; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which presents it as a **comprehensive framework** for building positive school cultures through relationship-building, open dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, and reducing suspensions—especially for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These references frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff listings, with restorative practices tied to proactive conflict resolution and community-building under the Access and Opportunity department.

This usage indicates that restorative approaches form a meaningful part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, shifting from punitive measures toward accountability, empathy, and growth—as seen in restorative justice's counseling focus and restorative practices' emphasis on hearing all voices to promote personal responsibility.[2] They are conceptualized as tools for positive cultural change, aligned with broader resilience-building efforts like the 11 traits (e.g., self-awareness, grit, empathy) promoted in OCPS Mentoring, rather than peripheral or one-off mentions.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices and related initiatives like Mentoring, PASS, and Vape Prevention; contact is directed to individuals like Christopher Ludwig for mentoring details, but nothing confirms implementation specifics at Meadowbrook Middle.[2]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Riverside Elementary in Orange, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[3][1 from scraped pages]** These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Riverside Elementary school website itself. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into a broader Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like OCPS District Police.[1 from scraped pages] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** surfaces on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (noting behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's work at Dillard St. Elementary, though without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3 from scraped pages][2 from scraped pages][3 from scraped pages]

This conceptualization positions Restorative Justice as a targeted intervention for at-risk students through external partnerships, while Restorative Practices reflects a proactive philosophical commitment within the district's Access and Opportunity department to create safe, inclusive environments that prioritize dialogue over punishment, aligning with broader goals of resilience-building and positive school cultures quoted from Solution Tree.[3 from scraped pages] These terms thus appear integrated into official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than peripheral mentions, suggesting they form part of OCPS's educational philosophy on discipline and climate, though not explicitly tied to Riverside Elementary or elementary settings specifically.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as named staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training programs, centers, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of Restorative Practices and the Civil Citation program's collaboration with law enforcement; OCPS Mentoring is mentioned nearby but focuses on resilience traits like self-awareness and grit without restorative links.[3 from scraped pages][1 from scraped pages] The scraped content lacks sufficient detail to assess full-scale implementation, training, or school-specific application, limiting insights into how these approaches operate beyond high-level descriptions.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are integral components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school culture framework**, though the available content does not provide school-specific implementation details for Apopka Elementary.

## Contextual Understanding

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices appear across multiple district-level web pages, indicating systematic integration rather than isolated initiatives. The terms appear on the district's site map under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, suggesting they are formally categorized within the district's organizational structure[4]. Additionally, OCPS maintains a dedicated Civil Citation program page that explicitly describes Restorative Justice as a partnership initiative between the school district, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department[1]. The district also hosts a dedicated ""Access and Opportunity"" page that features Restorative Practices as a key initiative alongside mentoring and other school climate programs[4].

## Philosophy Assessment

OCPS conceptualizes Restorative Practices as **a comprehensive framework for cultivating positive school cultures and reducing suspensions**, rather than as a punitive response mechanism[4]. The district's philosophy emphasizes relationship-building and collaborative problem-solving. According to the district's official description, Restorative Practices prioritize ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community"" and ensure ""that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts""[4]. This approach aims to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth,"" with specific focus on decreasing suspensions related to disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[4].

The Civil Citation program further demonstrates the district's commitment to addressing root causes: it ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem"" through partnership with law enforcement[1]. This reflects a preventative, rehabilitative philosophy rather than exclusionary discipline.

## Infrastructure

The district maintains formal organizational infrastructure supporting these initiatives. The ""Access and Opportunity"" department serves as the administrative home for Restorative Practices implementation[4]. While the provided content does not list specific staff positions dedicated to Restorative Justice at Apopka Elementary, the district-level job posting for a ""Restorative Justice & Wellness Specialist"" indicates that OCPS employs dedicated professionals to ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles""[5]. The Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) also supports these efforts through its ACCESS Program, which serves at-risk youth throughout the county[5].

## Limitations

The available content does not provide specific information about how Restorative Justice is implemented at Apopka Elementary individually. The terms appear only on district-level pages, not on school-specific websites. Therefore, while it is clear that OCPS as a district has adopted Restorative Justice as a formal approach, the extent to which Apopka Elementary specifically utilizes these practices, whether it has dedicated staff, or how the philosophy manifests in daily operations at that school cannot be determined from the provided content.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Sadler Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, with **Restorative Justice** presented as an established district-wide program and **restorative practices** positioned as a key initiative within the Access and Opportunity department to foster positive school cultures.[3][1 from scraped content: civil-citation page][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity page]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Sadler Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content: civil-citation page] **Restorative practices** appear in three contexts: listed under Access and Opportunity initiatives on the site map and main Access and Opportunity page, where it is detailed as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, particularly in middle and high schools; and peripherally on the Stellar Award Finalists page, honoring Lauren Fiallo, a behavior specialist at Dillard Street Elementary (not Sadler), whose interventions align with restorative principles though not explicitly labeled as such.[1 from scraped content: site_map][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity][1 from scraped content: 55601_4]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to its philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement within the **Access and Opportunity** department's mission to support positive school cultures through relationship-building and reduced suspensions, alongside related efforts like mentoring that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making.[3][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity] Restorative Justice is framed punitively as an alternative to traditional discipline for troubled youth via law enforcement collaboration, while restorative practices reflect a proactive, community-oriented educational strategy integrated into broader climate and culture efforts, indicating philosophical commitment rather than peripheral mentions.[1 from scraped content: civil-citation page]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without implementation specifics like staffing or protocols.[1 from scraped content: site_map][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity] Mentoring is mentioned proximally but not explicitly tied to restorative practices.[1 from scraped content: accessopportunity]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though mentions are limited and primarily tied to specific initiatives rather than comprehensive school-level implementation at William S. Maxey Elementary.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on the district site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, and detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile, but without elaboration.[1] These are program descriptions and departmental listings, not formal policies, mission statements, or school-specific content.

This suggests **restorative justice and practices form a peripheral element of OCPS's philosophy**, conceptualized as proactive tools for positive culture, resilience, and discipline alternatives within the broader Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps.[2] They align with initiatives like mentoring (emphasizing traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance) but lack evidence of deep integration into core educational approaches or elementary-level application at William S. Maxey Elementary.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or school-specific rollout.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Aloma Elementary**

Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Aloma Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and school climate approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[2][1 from scraped pages]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to address troubled students through counseling aimed at uncovering root causes of issues, rather than solely punitive measures; it links to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), listing it alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2][1 from scraped pages]

These references suggest **restorative practices** form part of the district's philosophy for fostering inclusive, productive school environments, aligning with broader goals of resilience-building and positive culture as articulated in Access and Opportunity's mission to narrow achievement gaps through safe, healthy settings; a quoted reflection emphasizes collaboration, learning from failures, and faculty support.[2] **Restorative Justice**, however, is conceptualized more narrowly as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, indicating a shift from traditional punishment toward root-cause counseling.[1 from scraped pages] While integrated into departmental strategies like Access and Opportunity—which oversees related efforts such as OCPS Mentoring focused on traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance—these appear as official program descriptions rather than core mission statements or policies, with no evidence of district-wide mandates or school-specific adoption at Aloma Elementary.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's umbrella initiatives; mentions remain high-level without implementation specifics like timelines, metrics, or school-level rollout.[2][1 from scraped pages] This limits assessment of practical integration, though restorative practices are positioned as proactive tools for community-building and suspension reduction.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate framework. The district explicitly incorporates these approaches as part of its official educational strategy, though the specific implementation at Orange Center Elementary is not detailed in the available content.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear across multiple district-level web pages rather than school-specific pages. The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the Civil Citation page, where OCPS describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues.[1] The term ""restorative practices"" appears in the district's site map navigation structure under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, indicating it is an official departmental focus area. Additionally, restorative practices are prominently featured on the Access and Opportunity homepage, which serves as a district-wide resource for school climate and culture initiatives.[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical shift in OCPS's approach to school discipline and student behavior. The district characterizes restorative practices as **a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate positive and supportive school environments** that prioritize relationship-building and conflict resolution over exclusionary discipline.[3] The philosophy centers on ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing conflicts, facilitating open dialogue, and empowering individuals to take responsibility for positive change.[3] Specifically, OCPS aims to significantly decrease school suspensions related to disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while simultaneously building community and teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.[3] This represents a deliberate philosophical transition from traditional punitive approaches toward restorative and preventative models.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices implementation. The ""Access and Opportunity"" department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] This department oversees multiple key initiatives, including restorative practices alongside mentoring and other school climate programs. Additionally, OCPS has created specialized positions such as Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists through its ACCESS Program, which is a public, WASC-accredited educational program serving at-risk youth throughout Orange County.[4] These specialists develop, plan, and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, conduct restorative circles, and collaborate with administration on comprehensive wellness programming.

However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated restorative justice infrastructure, staff positions, or programs at Orange Center Elementary itself.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Hungerford Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no school-specific details for Hungerford Elementary are evident.[1][4]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a formal program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem."" This positions it as an official partnership initiative linked to juvenile justice alternatives, including a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears twice: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under the Access and Opportunity department, and on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is elaborated as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and specifically reducing suspensions for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4] A partial mention also occurs on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), likely in a staff or initiative context amid behavior specialist profiles, but without full details.[1]

These terms reflect integration into OCPS's broader educational philosophy, particularly within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which commits to ""narrowing achievement gaps by fostering... safe, healthy, and inclusive learning... environments"" through positive school cultures.[4] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for ""troubled students"" via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing root-cause resolution over traditional punishment.[1] Restorative practices are framed more proactively as a relationship-centered framework for community-building, conflict resolution, and skill-building to prevent future issues, aligning with quotes on productive cultures where ""efforts that fail are learning experiences.""[4] This suggests a district-wide philosophy shifting toward restorative, non-exclusionary discipline, though mentions are program-descriptive rather than core mission statements.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts beyond the Access and Opportunity department's umbrella initiatives like Mentoring, School Support System, and PASS, which coexist with restorative practices listings.[4] The Civil Citation program's dashboard implies tracking mechanisms, but no specialized roles or training are named.[1] Thus, while philosophically supported, implementation infrastructure remains undescribed in available pages.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Phillis Wheatley Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and restorative practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.**[4]

Restorative Justice appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, restorative practices are mentioned on the district site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, a Stellar Award finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4] These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual mentions, suggesting intentional inclusion in district-wide support systems.

This usage indicates that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for safe, inclusive learning environments, as evidenced by their placement under Access and Opportunity, a department committed to narrowing achievement gaps through positive school cultures, climate management, and initiatives like mentoring that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[4] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, while restorative practices represent a proactive, relationship-focused strategy to prevent conflicts and teach interpersonal skills, aligning with the district's emphasis on collaboration and growth over punitive measures. However, the content does not detail how deeply these are embedded in daily educational practices or at elementary schools like Phillis Wheatley, portraying them more as supportive tools than core philosophy.

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly described, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for restorative approaches; mentions are nested within broader departments like Access and Opportunity and PASS (Positive Alternatives to Student Suspension, implied by context), with no evidence of school-specific implementation.[1][4]

"# Restorative Justice at Conway Middle / Orange: Analysis Summary

## Restorative Justice Presence

**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' district-wide approach**, though the available content does not provide specific information about Conway Middle's individual implementation of these initiatives. The terms appear consistently across the district's web infrastructure, indicating these are established components of the district's disciplinary and school climate philosophy rather than isolated pilot programs.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district-level pages within Orange County Public Schools' web ecosystem. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This framing positions restorative justice as a collaborative, intervention-focused approach rather than a punitive one.

The term ""restorative practices"" appears on the district's site map under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, indicating it is an organized initiative within the district's structure. The most substantive description appears on the Access and Opportunity homepage, where restorative practices are defined as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" with the explicit goal of ""reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] This context suggests the approach is intentionally targeted at the secondary level, which would include middle schools like Conway Middle.

## Philosophy Assessment

Based on the available content, restorative practices represent a **philosophical shift in how Orange County Public Schools approaches school discipline and climate**. The district conceptualizes these practices as relationship-centered rather than punishment-centered. The Access and Opportunity description emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[4]

The Civil Citation program further illustrates this philosophy by emphasizing that restorative justice ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem,""[1] suggesting the district views behavioral issues as symptoms requiring intervention rather than infractions requiring punishment. This approach aligns with addressing ""underlying causes of violence and misbehavior"" rather than relying solely on exclusionary discipline.

## Infrastructure

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices:

**Organizational Structure**: Restorative Practices are housed within the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, which operates at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801, with contact information (407-317-3200 x 2003470) available for inquiries. This placement within a dedicated department suggests institutional commitment and coordination across schools.

**Programs**: The district operates a ""Restorative Justice"" program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, accessible through a Civil Citation Dashboard that tracks school-based cases. This program is designed to divert students from traditional law enforcement processing.

**Staffing**: While the provided content does not list specific staff positions dedicated to restorative practices at Conway Middle, the district has created positions such as ""Restorative Justice & Wellness Specialist"" roles throughout Orange County to develop, plan, and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs.[5]

However, **the available content does not provide specific information about Conway Middle's dedicated staff, individual programs, or implementation details**. The content confirms the district's commitment to restorative practices but does not detail how these are operationalized at the school level.

"# Restorative Justice at Ivey Lane Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools district's approach to school discipline and climate, though the available content does not provide specific information about implementation at Ivey Lane Elementary itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the individual school's website, indicating that these initiatives are district-wide programs rather than school-specific approaches.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it within the district's broader climate and culture framework. The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most detailed description, framing restorative practices as an official district initiative focused on ""Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions.""[4]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative practices represent a core philosophical commitment within Orange County Public Schools' approach to school discipline and culture. According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, restorative practices are ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] The district conceptualizes these practices as alternatives to traditional punitive discipline, emphasizing dialogue, accountability, and community involvement. The approach is explicitly designed to address conflicts through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving"" that ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change.""[4] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously ""building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students.""[4]

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that restorative practices are administered through the district's Access and Opportunity department, which is located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[4] However, the provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, program coordinators, or specialized training programs related to restorative justice at the district or school level. The district has established restorative practices as a formal key initiative within its organizational structure, but the specific infrastructure—such as facilitators, specialists, or dedicated centers—is not detailed in the available web pages.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Ridgewood Park Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are currently implemented at Ridgewood Park Elementary itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the school's individual website, indicating that any restorative justice efforts would be district-directed rather than school-specific.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear across four district web pages. The Civil Citation page describes a partnership between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department in a program called ""Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Access and Opportunity page provides the most comprehensive description, positioning restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's broader climate and culture work. The term also appears in the district's site map navigation structure under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, suggesting it is an organized departmental focus rather than an incidental mention. These references are embedded within official district policy and program frameworks rather than appearing as passing mentions.

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as a **comprehensive framework designed to cultivate positive and supportive school environments** that prioritize relationship-building and conflict resolution over traditional punitive discipline.[4] The district's philosophy emphasizes that restorative practices aim to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously building community and teaching interpersonal skills.[4] This represents an integrated philosophical shift toward addressing underlying causes of misbehavior rather than exclusionary discipline. The civil citation program further reflects this philosophy by using counseling to address root causes of student behavioral issues.[1] However, the available content does not clarify whether this philosophy has been operationalized at Ridgewood Park Elementary specifically.

**Infrastructure**

The district maintains organizational infrastructure for restorative practices through the Access and Opportunity department, which lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative alongside other climate and culture programs.[4] The district also employs Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists who ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles.""[5] Additionally, OCPS has established a Civil Citation program in partnership with law enforcement agencies, which serves as an alternative to traditional school discipline.[1] However, the available content does not specify whether dedicated restorative justice staff or programs are assigned to Ridgewood Park Elementary or whether the school has implemented specific restorative circles, training initiatives, or dedicated coordinators.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, primarily through targeted programs and departmental initiatives aimed at improving student behavior and school climate.** These terms appear exclusively on the district website across four pages, with **restorative justice** mentioned once on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, presented as an official program description linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2] The term **restorative practices** appears three times: on the site map under the Access and Opportunity department's Climate & Culture section, indicating structural integration; on the Access and Opportunity home page as a core initiative described as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and peripherally on a Stellar Award Finalists page without substantive detail.[4]

This usage suggests **restorative justice and practices form a deliberate component of OCPS's philosophy for discipline and culture, integrated into their educational approach rather than mentioned peripherally.** The Civil Citation program's restorative justice emphasizes proactive counseling for at-risk students, aligning with root-cause intervention, while restorative practices under Access and Opportunity reflect a broader philosophy of relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and suspension reduction to create safe, inclusive environments—echoing the department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through positive cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree on valuing collaboration and learning from failures. These conceptualizations prioritize community, accountability, and harm repair over punitive measures, positioning them centrally within initiatives like mentoring and climate support.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational subunits beyond the Access and Opportunity department's listing of restorative practices alongside efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention; the Civil Citation program implies collaboration with law enforcement but lacks mentions of internal OCPS roles or training. This limits insight into implementation depth at Shenandoah Elementary specifically, as terms appear only district-wide without school-level evidence.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Winter Park High School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no school-specific details for Winter Park High School are evident from the content.[3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Winter Park High School site. ""Restorative Justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (without direct context in the scraped content), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3]

This usage indicates restorative approaches are embedded in OCPS's broader philosophy of fostering safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[3] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize relational, dialogue-driven strategies to prevent conflicts and teach interpersonal skills, shifting from punitive measures toward community-building and growth—core to the district's productive culture ideals quoted from Solution Tree.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice initiative, training details, or organizational units; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without elaboration on implementation structures.[3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Columbia Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs focused on student behavior, discipline alternatives, and positive school climates, though not as a district-wide philosophy or core policy.[3][1 from query] The term **Restorative Justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from query] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, and in detail on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3][1 from query] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile, but without elaboration.[1 from query] These mentions are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff assignments.

The content suggests restorative practices align with OCPS's philosophy of fostering safe, inclusive environments to narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's purpose of supporting positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building, with restorative practices listed alongside initiatives like mentoring that emphasize traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3][1 from query] Restorative Justice, however, is conceptualized more narrowly as a diversionary counseling tool for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, indicating peripheral integration into discipline rather than a holistic educational approach.[1 from query] No evidence shows it as a central tenet across the district or at Columbia Elementary specifically.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units; restorative practices is simply one key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details.[3][1 from query]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Oak Hill Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[3] These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, with no references on the Oak Hill Elementary school website: ""restorative justice"" on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), and ""restorative practices"" on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[1][2][3][4 from scraped content]. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[2] Restorative practices appear in the Access and Opportunity department's description as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[3][4 from scraped content]. The site map lists it under Access and Opportunity subpages like Climate & Culture and School Support System, suggesting departmental organization, while the Stellar Award Finalists page mentions it peripherally without elaboration.[1][4 from scraped content].

These concepts form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[3][4 from scraped content]. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, shifting from punitive measures, while restorative practices emphasize relational, dialogue-driven approaches to discipline and community-building, explicitly aimed at lowering suspension rates and empowering change.[2][3]. This integration appears intentional rather than peripheral, aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring (emphasizing traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance) under the same department, though not framed as a district-wide mandate or core mission statement element.[3].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without implementation specifics like staffing or protocols.[3][4 from scraped content]. The Civil Citation program implies some operational support through partnerships, but lacks details on school-level rollout, especially for elementary sites like Oak Hill.[2].

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Palmetto Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[3][1][2]**  

Restorative Justice appears specifically on the district's Civil Citation page, described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, linking to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, Restorative Practices is mentioned on three pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity (listing it alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring); a Stellar Award Finalists page featuring Lauren Fiallo, a behavior specialist at Dillard Street Elementary recognized for interventions that align with restorative principles, though not explicitly tied; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, positioning them as targeted initiatives within student support structures rather than passing references.[1][3]  

This usage suggests Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in Access and Opportunity's commitment to positive school cultures through collaboration, resilience-building, and reduced exclusionary discipline.[3] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and reactive conflict resolution to teach interpersonal skills and prevent future issues, while Restorative Justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk youth in collaboration with law enforcement, indicating a philosophy that integrates relational accountability into discipline without supplanting traditional measures.[1][3] However, the content does not depict it as a fully embedded district-wide educational core, appearing instead as specialized tools within broader safety and opportunity efforts.  

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational units; Restorative Practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without elaboration on roles like mentors (contacted via Christopher Ludwig for related resilience programs) or implementation logistics.[3] The Stellar Award recognition of a behavior specialist implies supportive expertise exists but lacks direct restorative labeling.[1] Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine the extent of infrastructure or school-specific application at Palmetto Elementary.

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary and school climate frameworks, though no specific mentions tie them directly to Pinar Elementary school itself.[1][2][4]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a formal program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem."" This positions it as an official partnership program integrated with law enforcement and the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation process, focusing on diversionary counseling for school-based incidents rather than punitive measures.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears twice: on the Access and Opportunity department page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is detailed as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment... with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools"" by prioritizing relationships, open dialogue, personal responsibility, and conflict resolution to address infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and on the site map page (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), listed under the Access and Opportunity department alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, MTSS, Mentoring, and PASS.[2][4] A brief mention also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), but only peripherally in staff profiles without substantive detail.[3]

These terms reflect a district philosophy emphasizing positive school cultures, resilience, and reduced exclusionary discipline over traditional punishment, aligning restorative approaches with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments and achievement gap reduction. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a root-cause intervention via counseling partnerships, while restorative practices form a proactive, relationship-centered framework to build community, teach interpersonal skills, and lower suspensions—integrated into the district's educational approach through the Access and Opportunity department rather than treated as peripheral or standalone mentions.[2][4]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details like training or staffing.[2][4] The district's Mentoring program, which promotes resilience traits like empathy and responsible decision-making, complements this philosophy but is not explicitly restorative.[2]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Orange County Public Schools District Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate framework. The district explicitly incorporates these approaches as part of its official educational strategy, though the available content does not provide detailed information specific to Apopka High School's individual implementation.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear across multiple district-level web pages rather than school-specific pages. The terms appear in the district's site map under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, indicating they are part of the district's formal organizational structure[1]. On the Civil Citation page, OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in ""creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] Additionally, restorative practices are listed as a key initiative within the Access and Opportunity department, which is responsible for ""narrowing achievement gaps by fostering an environment conducive to learning"" and ""assisting schools in maintaining safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments.""[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment.""[2] The district's philosophy emphasizes relationship-building and conflict resolution as central to reducing suspensions. According to the district's official description, ""This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] A core principle is that ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts,"" with the framework facilitating ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving"" to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[2] The district specifically targets suspensions related to ""disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" through these practices.[2]

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that restorative practices are administered through the district's Access and Opportunity department, which operates at the district level rather than individual school level. However, the provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, program centers, or training initiatives at Apopka High School or detailed infrastructure supporting restorative justice implementation at individual schools. The district does employ Restorative Justice Specialists in some Orange County schools through partnerships, as evidenced by references to specialists working in other districts' schools, but specific staffing for Apopka High is not documented in the available content.

**Limitation**

Based on the available content from the district website, it is not possible to determine the specific extent to which Restorative Justice is implemented at Apopka High School or what dedicated infrastructure exists at that individual school. The content confirms that OCPS as a district has adopted restorative practices as a framework, but school-specific implementation details are not provided in the materials reviewed.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Magnolia School in Orange, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[3][1 from scraped pages]** These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Magnolia School website itself. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a specific partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** appears three times: as a menu item under the Access and Opportunity department on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) and a Stellar Award page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and in a detailed description on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[2 from scraped pages][3] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, with the most substantive context on Access and Opportunity portraying Restorative Practices as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3]

This presence suggests Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's broader philosophy on school climate and discipline, aligned with creating ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments"" via the Access and Opportunity department, which also encompasses initiatives like mentoring focused on resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility, perseverance).[3] The Civil Citation integration positions Restorative Justice as a proactive alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses, emphasizing root-cause counseling over punitive measures.[1 from scraped pages] However, the mentions are somewhat peripheral—lacking elaboration on classroom integration, outcomes data, or ties to Magnolia School specifically—and do not indicate it as a core, district-wide philosophy like the Strategic Plan 2030 or Code of Civility.[2 from scraped pages] The district conceptualizes these approaches as relationship-centered tools for positive culture, conflict resolution, and suspension reduction, echoing broader restorative principles of accountability and community-building.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; Restorative Practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on roles or resources.[3][2 from scraped pages] The Stellar Award page mentions it alongside other supports like Mentoring and PASS but only in a departmental context, not as implemented programs.[2 from scraped pages] Overall, while present, the content offers insufficient detail to assess full integration or effectiveness, appearing more as named initiatives within student support structures than a robust, evidenced system.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for West Orange High School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and positive school climates, though specific implementation at West Orange High School is not detailed in the available content.[3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the West Orange High School site. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into a broader civil citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[2] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, signaling its place in school support structures; on the Stellar Award Finalists page, it is peripherally linked to a behavior specialist's work at Dillard St. Elementary, though not central to the profile; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

The content suggests restorative practices align with OCPS's philosophy of fostering positive, productive school cultures through collaboration, resilience-building, and proactive conflict resolution, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's purpose statement quoting Solution Tree on supportive environments where failures become learning experiences.[3] Restorative justice, by contrast, is conceptualized more narrowly as a diversionary counseling intervention for disciplinary issues via law enforcement partnerships.[2] While integrated into the district's educational support approach—particularly for narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe, inclusive environments—the mentions are not pervasive, indicating a targeted rather than district-wide philosophical cornerstone.

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed, such as named coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs; restorative practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, MTSS, and vape prevention, but without specified staff roles or structures.[3] The Civil Citation program's restorative justice component implies operational ties to district police and external agencies, yet lacks elaboration on internal supports.[2]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Liberty Middle School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.**[4][5]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[5] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1][4]

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and shifting from punitive to supportive discipline**, aligning with broader Access and Opportunity goals of narrowing achievement gaps through positive cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree on collaborative, learning-oriented schools.[4] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and reactive conflict resolution to teach interpersonal skills and prevent future issues, while Restorative Justice targets counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, indicating an integrated educational approach rather than peripheral mentions.[1][4][5] However, the content lacks evidence of it as a core mission statement element or district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational departments solely for these practices—mentions remain descriptive without implementation specifics like training protocols or metrics.[1][4][5] The Access and Opportunity department oversees related efforts like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits including empathy and responsibility), but restorative elements appear as one initiative among others like MTSS and vape prevention, listed on the site map.[4]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Washington Shores Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[1][5]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Washington Shores Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem,"" linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without context amid staff profiles, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a ""comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and aiming to reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools—specifically targeting infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while building community and teaching interpersonal skills.[5]

This usage positions restorative approaches as integral to the district's philosophy within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive school cultures, as evidenced by its inclusion alongside initiatives like mentoring and resilience-building (e.g., 11 traits including empathy and perseverance).[5] The Civil Citation program's restorative justice emphasis on root-cause counseling suggests a rehabilitative rather than purely punitive stance on student misconduct, aligning with broader cultural goals quoted from Solution Tree on collaborative, learning-oriented school environments.[1][5] However, the mentions are program-descriptive and navigational rather than embedded in formal policies, mission statements, or detailed implementation guides, indicating philosophical endorsement without evidence of school-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further elaboration on supports like facilitators or professional development.[5] The Stellar Award page's passing reference in a behavior specialist's profile implies practical application by staff but lacks details on systemic rollout.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Eccleston Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide efforts to address student behavior, build positive school cultures, and reduce disciplinary actions, though specific implementation at Eccleston Elementary is not detailed in the available content.[3]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school environments, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, indicating programmatic rather than foundational emphasis.

This suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for school climate and discipline, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and addressing underlying behavioral issues to promote resilience and reduce punitive measures, aligning with broader Access and Opportunity goals of safe, inclusive environments alongside initiatives like mentoring that emphasize traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3] However, the content portrays these as peripheral or supportive elements—linked to civil citations for justice-oriented interventions and suspension reduction—rather than deeply integrated across all educational approaches, with no evidence of district-wide mandates or core philosophical tenets.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices are listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or resources.[3]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Orange County Public Schools District Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are clearly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school culture. The district has integrated these terms into multiple official channels and initiatives, indicating a deliberate commitment to this framework rather than a peripheral mention.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear across four distinct district webpages, each serving different purposes. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This positioning emphasizes restorative justice as a collaborative, law enforcement-integrated approach to student intervention.

Restorative practices appear on the district's site map under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, indicating organizational recognition and structural placement within the district's administrative hierarchy.[2] The most substantive content appears on the Access and Opportunity homepage, where restorative practices are featured as a key initiative under the department's ""Key Initiatives"" section. This placement suggests that restorative practices are considered a primary focus area rather than a supplementary program.

The Stellar Award Finalists page mentions restorative practices in the context of teacher recognition, though the specific reference is limited in the provided content excerpt.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school climate and student discipline. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3]

The philosophy emphasizes inclusive dialogue and shared responsibility: ""A core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] The district specifically targets three key disciplinary infractions—disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—as areas where restorative practices aim to ""significantly decrease school suspensions.""[3]

This framework extends beyond conflict resolution to encompass broader school culture development, with the district noting that restorative practices ""actively build community and promote healthy interactions between educators and students"" while teaching ""essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills"" to proactively reduce future conflicts.[3]

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices implementation. The Access and Opportunity department serves as the organizational home for restorative practices initiatives, with a dedicated contact structure (Christopher Ludwig is listed as a point of contact for related mentoring programs).[3] The district website indicates that restorative practices are embedded within a broader ""School Support System"" that includes multiple complementary initiatives such as mentoring, classroom management support, and climate and culture development.[2]

Additionally, OCPS has created a Restorative Justice & Wellness Specialist position through the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE), which works to ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles.""[4] These specialists collaborate with school administration to develop comprehensive wellness programs and connect with community outreach initiatives.

The district's partnership with law enforcement agencies (Sheriff's Office and Police Department) through the Civil Citation program represents another structural element, creating a formal mechanism for identifying troubled students and providing counseling-based interventions.[1]

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate approach. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and are presented as official initiatives rather than pilot programs or peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts across the OCPS district website. First, on the Civil Citation page, ""Restorative Justice"" is presented as a formal partnership program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This positions Restorative Justice as a collaborative intervention strategy involving law enforcement and school-based counseling.

Second, ""Restorative Practices"" appears on the district's site map under the Access and Opportunity department, indicating it is an officially recognized initiative within the district's organizational structure.[2] Third, the Access and Opportunity homepage provides the most comprehensive description, dedicating a section to ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions.""[2] Fourth, Restorative Practices are mentioned in the context of staff recognition, appearing in materials related to the Stellar Award Finalists page, suggesting these practices are integrated into how the district recognizes and values educator work.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical shift in how OCPS approaches school discipline and climate. The district conceptualizes these practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] The approach emphasizes dialogue and problem-solving: ""A core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[2]

This philosophy reflects a departure from purely punitive discipline toward addressing underlying causes of misbehavior. The Restorative Justice program specifically aims to ""identify troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem,""[1] suggesting the district views behavioral issues as symptoms requiring intervention rather than infractions requiring punishment alone.

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not provide detailed information about dedicated staff positions, specific program names beyond ""Restorative Justice"" and ""Restorative Practices,"" or formal organizational structures dedicated to these initiatives. The content indicates that Restorative Practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department, which is located at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801, and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[2] However, specific coordinator titles, facilitator positions, training programs, or implementation timelines are not detailed in the provided content.

The district does reference a ""Restorative Practices Resources"" page on the OCDE website that discusses implementation phases and cites RAND Corporation research showing that ""the practices had a positive effect in schools by reducing school suspensions,""[3] but the specific infrastructure supporting these practices at the school or district level is not elaborated in the available materials.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Deerwood Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[2][6]**

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the district's Civil Citation page, framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and a Stellar Award Finalists page in a staff listing context without elaboration.[2][6] These references occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or dedicated staff profiles, indicating targeted rather than pervasive mentions.[1][2]

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering inclusive, relationship-focused environments and alternatives to traditional punishment**, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's efforts to narrow achievement gaps through safe, healthy school climates. Restorative Practices are conceptualized as proactive tools for community-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts and lower suspension rates in middle and high schools, while Restorative Justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships—aligning with broader goals like resilience-building through mentoring and traits such as empathy and responsibility.[2][6] However, the content portrays these as peripheral components rather than a fully integrated district-wide educational philosophy, with no evidence of school-specific adoption at Deerwood Elementary.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, centers, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's general oversight; references imply facilitation by trained school staff (administrators, teachers, or counselors) using methods like affective statements, restorative questions, and conflict resolution circles, but without specifics on roles, scale, or resources.[2][6]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though the available content provides limited details on implementation specific to Prairie Lake Elementary, with terms appearing only on district website pages rather than the school site.[1][4]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the ""Civil Citation"" page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a formal district program partnered with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events, positioning it as an alternative disciplinary tool rather than a broad educational policy.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under ""Access and Opportunity"" departments like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) indirectly via behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's work at Dillard St. Elementary, though not explicitly linked; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[4] There, it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and **reduce suspensions** in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—emphasizing proactive community-building over punishment.[4]

This suggests restorative approaches form a **core element of the district's philosophy for safe, inclusive learning environments**, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps and support resilience via initiatives like OCPS Mentoring (focusing on traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance).[4] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a targeted intervention for disciplinary issues, while restorative practices represent a broader, relationship-centered strategy aligned with positive school cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree: schools where collaboration, learning from failures, and faculty support prevail.[4] However, these mentions are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than detailed mission statements or policies, indicating integration into educational approaches but not centrality to overall district identity.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed alongside efforts like MTSS, PASS, and Vape Prevention under Access and Opportunity, but without implementation details, staff titles, or school-level rollout.[4] Behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's award highlights related expertise in interventions for students with autism, but does not confirm restorative practices involvement.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices** appear in limited mentions across websites associated with Devereux Treatment Program / Orange and Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), but the content does not demonstrate a comprehensive or integrated approach to these concepts within the school's or district's core operations.

The term **restorative justice** is referenced twice: once on the OCPS district page at https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation, where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, presented as part of a ""Civil Citation"" initiative linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events[1]; and once on a Devereux page at https://www.devereux.org/site/SPageServer/?pagename=international_Olanzer_Cameron, though in a truncated snippet without contextual details tying it to specific practices or programs[2]. The term **restorative practices** appears three times: twice on Devereux's Center for Effective Schools (CES) literature pages (https://www.devereux.org/site/SPageServer/PageServer?pagename=ces_literature and https://www.devereux.org/site/SPageServer/SPageServer/PageServer?pagename=ces_literature), amid lists of evidence-based research topics like School-Wide Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (SWPBIS), without elaboration[3][4]; and once on the OCPS site map at https://www.ocps.net/site_map, nested under ""Access and Opportunity"" alongside initiatives like MTSS, Mentoring, and PASS, suggesting a peripheral link to school support systems. On https://www.ocps.net/55601_4, it appears in a truncated Stellar Award Finalists context without further detail. These are passing mentions in program descriptions, site navigation, and research bibliographies rather than official policies, mission statements, or detailed implementations.

Based on the content, **restorative justice does not appear to be a central part of the school or district's philosophy**. Devereux's CES emphasizes evidence-based practices for children with emotional and behavioral disorders, focusing on systems like Social Emotional Learning, MTSS, and SWPBIS, with restorative practices noted only in research literature without integration into their described approach[3][4]. OCPS frames restorative justice narrowly within the Civil Citation diversion program for disciplinary issues, emphasizing counseling over punitive measures, but without evidence of broader adoption[1]. No conceptualization is provided, such as definitions of harm repair or community building.

No dedicated **infrastructure** for restorative justice or practices is evident. There are no mentions of staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, specific programs like Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments. OCPS's Civil Citation references external law enforcement partnerships but lacks internal structures[1], while Devereux pages highlight general behavioral health services without restorative-specific elements[2][3][4].

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Orange Technical College South Campus, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the specific school level.**[2][7]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling to reach the root cause of problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and peripherally on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4).[2] There, it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[2][7]

These concepts appear integrated into OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments, as evidenced by their placement within the **Access and Opportunity Department**, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through positive climates, climate and culture management, and related initiatives like mentoring and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports).[2] Restorative Practices aligns with district goals of resilience-building (e.g., traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance) and is positioned as a proactive alternative to traditional discipline, emphasizing collaboration over punishment.[2][7] However, the mentions are primarily programmatic descriptions and menu listings rather than detailed policies, mission statements, or evaluations, suggesting a philosophical commitment without full elaboration on systemic embedding.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity Department's umbrella initiatives like Mentoring, PASS, and School Support System, where Restorative Practices fits alongside efforts like vape prevention and ICU (likely Intensive Care Unit for behavior).[2] A district discipline guide references Restorative Practices for addressing behavior offenses qualifying for alternatives to suspension, but lacks specifics on rollout.[7] This indicates intentional inclusion without evident standalone programs or roles.

""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and uses counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under Access and Opportunity, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is presented as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2]

These references indicate that restorative approaches form part of the district's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as embedded within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school climates through relationship-building and proactive conflict skills.[2] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a diversionary counseling intervention for disciplinary issues via civil citations, while restorative practices emphasize collaborative dialogue over punishment to repair harm and prevent future conflicts, aligning with broader goals of resilience and community support seen in related initiatives like OCPS Mentoring.[2] However, the mentions are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than core mission statements or policies, suggesting integration into educational support strategies but not as a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or school-specific rollout.[1][2]

"# Restorative Justice at Palm Lake Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are currently implemented at Palm Lake Elementary itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the individual school's website, indicating that these are district-level programs and frameworks rather than school-specific implementations.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department, described as a program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a subsection under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it within the district's broader climate and culture initiatives.[1] The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most substantive description, framing restorative practices as a comprehensive framework within the district's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's Access and Opportunity department. According to the district's official description, restorative practices are ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that these practices ensure ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] The district specifically aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while actively building community and teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.[3] This philosophy reflects a shift from traditional punitive discipline toward relationship-centered, healing-focused approaches.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established restorative practices within an organizational structure that includes the Access and Opportunity department, which operates from 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] However, the available content does not identify dedicated staff positions, specific programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures directly tied to restorative practices at the district or school level. The Civil Citation program represents one concrete initiative linking restorative justice to law enforcement partnerships, but specific implementation details, staff roles, or program names are not provided in the available content.

**Conclusion**

Based on the available content, restorative practices are clearly part of OCPS's district-level philosophy and approach to school climate and discipline, but the specific implementation at Palm Lake Elementary cannot be determined from the provided sources. The district has articulated a clear commitment to these practices as part of its Access and Opportunity initiatives, yet the content does not provide sufficient detail about how these frameworks are operationalized at individual schools or whether Palm Lake Elementary participates in these programs.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Ventura Elementary in Orange County, Florida, incorporates both Restorative Justice and restorative practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.** Restorative Justice appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events[4]. This positions it as an official intervention for disciplinary matters involving law enforcement collaboration, rather than a passing mention. In contrast, restorative practices are referenced on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) highlighting a behavior specialist's work, though without direct linkage; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a **comprehensive framework** to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[4].

These terms reflect a philosophical commitment to proactive, relationship-centered discipline within OCPS's broader educational approach, as evidenced by their placement in key departmental sections like Access and Opportunity, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and ties restorative practices to resilience-building alongside mentoring[4]. Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a targeted counseling-based diversion for at-risk students interfacing with justice systems, while restorative practices emphasize community-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts, aligning with quotes on productive school cultures that value collaboration and learning from failures[4]. However, the content does not indicate deep philosophical integration, such as in mission statements or across all schools, suggesting a peripheral rather than core role, especially since Ventura Elementary's specific website yields no mentions.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident from the scraped pages, including staff positions like coordinators or specialists, named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices appear as a listed initiative under Access and Opportunity without further elaboration on implementation supports[4]. The district's approach thus seems programmatic in discipline diversion and aspirational in school climate efforts, but the content lacks sufficient detail to assess widespread adoption or effectiveness at Ventura Elementary or district-wide.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school culture, though specific implementation at Simon Youth Foundation Academy at Outlet Marketplace/Orange is not detailed in the available content.**

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events[2]. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three other district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which highlights it peripherally amid behavior specialist recognitions; and the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which provides the most detailed program description[2]. These mentions frame restorative practices as part of official program descriptions within the Access and Opportunity department, focused on climate, culture, and discipline alternatives, rather than policies, staff listings, or mission statements.

This approach reflects a core element of OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly in fostering positive school cultures and reducing suspensions. On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices are conceptualized as a **comprehensive framework** prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues—specifically targeting infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[2]. The Civil Citation program's restorative justice component aligns with this by emphasizing counseling over punitive measures for troubled students[2]. While integrated into district initiatives like Mentoring and School Support Systems (listed on the site map), these terms are not peripheral but actively tied to goals of resilience, empathy, and inclusive environments, as seen in broader department efforts to narrow achievement gaps through safe learning spaces[2].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Orange Technical College, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the content provides limited depth on implementation specifics.[2][5]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Orange Technical College school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist profiles; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), described as a framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2][5]

The district conceptualizes these approaches philosophically as tools for positive school climates and proactive discipline, aligning with broader goals of resilience, inclusivity, and reduced punitive measures rather than peripheral mentions. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes counseling for underlying issues in a law enforcement-linked program, while **restorative practices** prioritize relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, personal responsibility, and teaching social-emotional skills to prevent conflicts, explicitly aiming to lower middle and high school suspensions.[2][5] This integration appears in official program descriptions under Access and Opportunity, a department committed to safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, and in discipline guides promoting practices like affective statements, restorative questions, circles, and conflict resolution facilitated by trained staff.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, or training programs; references instead note general ""trained school staff members"" (administrators, teachers, counselors) facilitating practices, with successful completion serving as an alternative consequence.[5] The Access and Opportunity department oversees related initiatives like mentoring, but restorative elements lack standalone programs or structures beyond these broad integrations.[2]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Orange Technical College West Campus school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events handled by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1 from query] **Restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without detailed context amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][1 from query]

This usage positions **restorative justice** as an official, inter-agency program description tied to diversion from traditional juvenile justice, while **restorative practices** functions as a proactive educational strategy within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps via safe, inclusive environments, suggesting philosophical integration into district-wide school climate efforts rather than peripheral or one-off references.[3][1 from query] The district conceptualizes these approaches as relationship-focused alternatives to punitive measures, emphasizing counseling, dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, and skill-building to foster resilience, community, and reduced exclusions, aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring that highlight traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[1 from query]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity without detailing roles, budgets, or implementation protocols, and no campus-specific structures are mentioned.[1 from query][3]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Rock Springs Elementary, integrates restorative justice and restorative practices into its disciplinary and cultural framework as evidenced by explicit mentions on district website pages.** Restorative Justice appears prominently in the Civil Citation program description, where the district describes partnering with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice interventions via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard[2]. Restorative Practices are referenced multiple times, including in the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives, and detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[2]. A passing mention also occurs in a Stellar Award Finalists page, likely contextualizing staff expertise, though specifics are truncated[2].

These terms are embedded in official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than peripheral staff listings or mission statements, indicating intentional integration into district operations; for instance, the Access and Opportunity department frames restorative practices as central to creating safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps through collaboration and proactive skill-building in interpersonal relations[2]. This suggests a district philosophy that prioritizes restorative approaches over punitive measures, conceptualizing them as tools for relationship-building, empathy-driven problem-solving, and resilience development—aligning with broader initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes traits such as self-awareness, grit, and responsible decision-making[2].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; however, implementation involves trained school staff like administrators, teachers, or counselors facilitating restorative circles, affective statements, and conflict resolution processes[2]. The absence of school-specific details on Rock Springs Elementary's site limits insights into localized application, but district-wide efforts imply availability at the school level through the Access and Opportunity department.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Metrowest Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[2] These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, with no references on the Metrowest Elementary school website: ""restorative justice"" on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), and ""restorative practices"" on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[1][2] On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated into a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses.[1] Restorative practices appear in the Access and Opportunity department's description as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; the site map lists it under school support initiatives alongside climate & culture, MTSS, and mentoring; and the Stellar Award page notes it peripherally in a behavior specialist's profile at Dillard St. Elementary, though without detailing implementation.[2]

These concepts form part of OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission, which emphasizes positive school cultures through collaboration, resilience-building, and proactive relationship maintenance rather than punitive measures.[2] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students to resolve underlying issues, while restorative practices are framed as a proactive, dialogue-driven approach to conflict that teaches interpersonal skills and prevents future disruptions, aligning with district goals like resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility) in mentoring programs.[2] However, the mentions are program-specific rather than centrally embedded in overarching mission statements or policies, suggesting integration into support systems but not as a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units solely for these practices; restorative practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), and restorative justice operates via partnerships without mentioned internal roles.[2] The Civil Citation dashboard implies tracking mechanisms, but details on training or school-level rollout are absent, limiting visibility into implementation depth.

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate approach. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and are presented as formal initiatives rather than peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts within the OCPS district website. First, ""Restorative Justice"" is featured on the Civil Citation page, where OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in a program called ""Restorative Justice"" that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] Second, ""Restorative Practices"" appears in the district's site map navigation structure, indicating it is a recognized departmental or programmatic area within the district's organizational hierarchy.[2] Third, the term appears in reference to the Stellar Award Finalists page, suggesting it may be connected to recognized educational practices within the district. Fourth, and most substantially, ""Restorative Practices"" is featured prominently on the Access and Opportunity home page, a dedicated district department focused on school climate and culture.[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school discipline and culture. According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, **Restorative Practices are conceptualized as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment.""**[3] The district emphasizes that this approach ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] A fundamental principle underlying the district's philosophy is that ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts,"" with the practices designed to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously ""building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students"" and ""teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.""[3]

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support Restorative Practices implementation. The **Access and Opportunity department** serves as the primary administrative unit overseeing these initiatives, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando with a dedicated contact line (407-317-3200 x 2003470).[3] Within this department, Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative alongside other school climate and culture programs. Additionally, OCPS has created a **Restorative Justice program** in partnership with law enforcement agencies (the Sheriff's Office and Police Department) that operates through the Civil Citation process, identifying and providing counseling support to troubled students.[1] The district also employs **Restorative Justice & Wellness Specialists** who ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles and provide safety and security at school site"" and ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth.""[4] These positions are located throughout Orange County and represent dedicated staffing for restorative justice implementation.

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school culture framework. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and represent formal initiatives rather than peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct district web pages. On the Civil Citation page, **Restorative Justice** is presented as a formal partnership program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This framing positions Restorative Justice as a law enforcement and school collaboration focused on early intervention and root-cause analysis rather than punitive responses.

**Restorative Practices** appears more prominently on the Access and Opportunity departmental page, which is dedicated to school climate and culture initiatives. The district describes Restorative Practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] The page emphasizes that these practices ensure ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving"" to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[4] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[4]

The term also appears in the site map navigation structure under the Access and Opportunity department, indicating it is an organized, catalogued initiative within district operations.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical shift in OCPS's approach to school discipline and culture. Rather than viewing discipline as purely punitive, the district conceptualizes these frameworks as relationship-building and problem-solving mechanisms. The philosophy centers on identifying underlying causes of student behavior, facilitating dialogue between affected parties, and developing student responsibility and empathy. This approach is integrated into the district's broader ""Access and Opportunity"" initiative, which aims to ""narrow achievement gaps by fostering an environment conducive to learning"" through ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments.""[4] The integration into a dedicated departmental structure suggests these are not peripheral programs but foundational to how OCPS approaches school climate and student discipline.

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that Restorative Practices fall under the **Access and Opportunity department**, which operates at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801 (407-317-3200 x 2003470).[4] However, the provided content does not identify specific staff positions dedicated to Restorative Justice or Restorative Practices coordination, nor does it name dedicated centers or programs with specific titles. The district references broader support structures, including school social workers who provide ""counseling and support groups"" and ""crisis intervention,""[8] which may support restorative processes, but no explicit connection is stated in the available material.

Additionally, OC Human Relations operates a **Restorative Schools Program** in eight Orange County schools (Ball Jr. High School, Brookhurst Jr. High School, Columbus Tustin Middle School, Dale Jr. High School, La Quinta High School, Pacifica High School, Sycamore Junior High, and Tustin High School), which provides consultation, mentoring, modeling sessions, and case management for restorative justice processes.[2] Since 2017, this program has achieved a 97% resolution rate across over 1,000 referred cases.[2] However, the provided content does not specify whether Arbor Ridge K-8 participates in this program.

"# Restorative Justice at Windy Ridge K-8 / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are uniquely implemented at Windy Ridge K-8 itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on school-specific pages, indicating that restorative approaches are district initiatives that may be available to or implemented across schools within the district, including Windy Ridge K-8.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a collaborative program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] On the Access and Opportunity Home page, restorative practices are described as a key initiative within the district's broader commitment to fostering positive school cultures and reducing suspensions.[3] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a navigational item under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it as an official district program area.[1] These mentions appear in official policy and program descriptions rather than as peripheral references.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as a systematic approach to school discipline and culture. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The underlying philosophy emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] The district's approach specifically targets ""school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously building community and teaching interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.[3] This reflects a shift from purely punitive discipline toward healing and relationship-centered justice.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative within this department's portfolio. Additionally, the district employs specialized staff, including a Restorative Practices Coordinator at the Orange County Department of Education and Learning Support Services, though the specific coordinator's name and direct contact information are not provided in the available content.[7] The district also partners with external organizations such as OC Human Relations (Groundswell) to implement restorative programs in schools, with documented success: over 1,000 cases referred for restorative conflict resolution processes have achieved an average resolution rate of 97%.[1][2]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Bay Meadows Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the school level is not detailed in the available content.[3][1][2]**  

Restorative Justice appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnered program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, Restorative Practices is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity resources, and elaborated on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), listing it alongside other initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS without further detail.[2] These mentions position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than staff listings, mission statements, or policies, suggesting programmatic rather than foundational emphasis.[1][2][3]  

This usage indicates Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[3] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and reactive conflict resolution to minimize punitive measures, while Restorative Justice targets counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, reflecting a shift toward root-cause intervention over traditional discipline.[1][3] However, the content portrays these as targeted initiatives rather than fully integrated across all educational approaches, with no evidence of centrality to Bay Meadows Elementary specifically.[1][2][3]  

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as named staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), standalone programs, training initiatives, or organizational units beyond their placement under the Access and Opportunity department; Restorative Practices is simply listed as a key initiative without operational details like staffing or rollout plans.[3] The Civil Citation integration implies some administrative tracking via dashboards, but lacks specifics on facilitators or school-level execution.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though specific implementation at John Young Elementary is not detailed in the available content, which derives solely from district pages.[5][1 from scraped pages]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal district program in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events under agencies like OCPS District Police. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures.[5]

These references indicate restorative approaches form a core element of OCPS's disciplinary and cultural philosophy, shifting from punitive measures toward relationship-building and accountability. The Access and Opportunity department conceptualizes restorative practices as prioritizing ""strong relationships among all members of the school community,"" ensuring ""all voices are heard"" in conflict resolution via open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving to enhance personal responsibility and reduce suspensions—specifically targeting disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools. This aligns with broader initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility) under the same department, suggesting an integrated philosophy of proactive, inclusive environments over exclusionary discipline.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, or centers; terms appear in program overviews and partnerships rather than staff listings or structural details. The Civil Citation-Restorative Justice program implies operational collaboration with law enforcement, while restorative practices tie into the Access and Opportunity department's school support efforts (e.g., alongside MTSS, mentoring, and vape prevention), but lack specifics on training, dedicated roles, or school-level rollout—particularly for elementary sites like John Young.[1 from scraped pages][5]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Clay Springs Elementary**

**Restorative Justice** is explicitly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach through a dedicated partnership program, while **restorative practices** form a key initiative within the district's Access and Opportunity department aimed at building positive school cultures.[2][1 from scraped content: civil-citation page] The district integrates these concepts to address student misbehavior proactively, focusing on counseling, relationship-building, and suspension reduction rather than solely punitive measures.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Clay Springs Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content: civil-citation] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (noting a behavior specialist's work but without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for fostering relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity, site_map, 55601_4] These are presented as official program descriptions and departmental priorities, not mere passing mentions or staff listings.

The content positions both as integral to OCPS's disciplinary philosophy, shifting from punishment to rehabilitation and community-building. **Restorative justice** is conceptualized as an intervention for at-risk youth via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing root-cause counseling over traditional juvenile justice responses.[1 from scraped content: civil-citation] **Restorative practices** align with a broader commitment to ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments"" and ""positive, productive school cultures,"" linking to resilience traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance in the OCPS Mentoring program on the same page.[2] This suggests a cohesive philosophy prioritizing dialogue, collaboration, and skill-building to prevent conflicts, though implementation details like outcomes or scope for elementary schools like Clay Springs are not specified.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training programs, centers, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these terms. References occur within broader departments like Access and Opportunity (which handles climate, culture, mentoring, and restorative practices) and Civil Citation processes, but without named roles, budgets, or school-level rollout plans.[2][1 from scraped content: accessopportunity, civil-citation] The Stellar Award mention of behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary highlights related intervention expertise but does not connect to district restorative programs.[1 from scraped content: 55601_4]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of University High / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no mentions exist on the University High school website itself.[2]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events tracked by agencies like the Orange County Sheriff's Office and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief departmental context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—targeting middle and high schools.[2]

These references indicate that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support productive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building. Restorative practices align with broader emphases on traits like empathy, responsible decision-making, and perseverance via initiatives such as OCPS Mentoring, positioning them as proactive tools for community-building and skill development rather than mere disciplinary alternatives. However, **restorative justice** seems more peripherally tied to external law enforcement collaborations for civil citations, while restorative practices reflect a district-wide educational philosophy shift toward relational, non-punitive interventions.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's general oversight, which lists restorative practices alongside efforts like mentoring, MTSS, and vape prevention without naming personnel or structured implementation. The Civil Citation program's restorative justice component implies operational collaboration with police but lacks descriptions of internal school-level supports.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Waterbridge Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on implementation specifics at the elementary school level.[3]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Waterbridge Elementary school website. **Restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[3] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award Finalists page amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, reduce suspensions (especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations), foster relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and teach interpersonal skills.[3]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual mentions; for instance, restorative justice ties directly to a civil citation alternative to traditional juvenile justice processing, while restorative practices form a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, which focuses on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps through climate and culture efforts like mentoring.[3]

**Restorative justice** and practices appear peripherally yet intentionally integrated into the district's educational philosophy, conceptualized as proactive, relationship-centered alternatives to punitive discipline that emphasize root-cause counseling, dialogue, accountability, and community-building to lower suspensions and promote resilience—aligning with broader goals like positive school cultures quoted from Solution Tree and traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making in the OCPS Mentoring program.[3] They are not central to overarching mission statements in the scraped content but are presented as targeted strategies within accountability and opportunity frameworks, suggesting a philosophical shift toward restorative over exclusionary measures without evidence of district-wide mandates or deep philosophical exposition.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), but without details on staffing, training, or school-specific rollout, and no links to Waterbridge Elementary implementation.[3] The Stellar Award recognition of behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard Street Elementary implies supportive practices in behavior interventions but does not confirm restorative-specific roles.[3]

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of AMIkids Orlando/Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within student support and disciplinary frameworks, though no direct evidence ties them explicitly to AMIkids Orlando/Orange operations.[1][2] The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a district program partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[3] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) listing it under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) with no substantive context; and the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which defines it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools.[4]

These references position restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments through collaboration and resilience-building, quoting Solution Tree on productive school cultures.[4] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a diversionary counseling program for at-risk students to prevent juvenile justice involvement, while restorative practices emphasize proactive relationship-building and dialogue for behavioral improvement, aligning with broader goals like resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility, perseverance) in OCPS Mentoring.[4] However, the mentions are program-descriptive rather than core mission statements, suggesting philosophical integration into support systems but not as a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; restorative practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity initiatives without elaboration on implementation, staff, or resources.[4] The Civil Citation program's restorative justice component implies operational ties to law enforcement dashboards but lacks specifics on school-level rollout.[3]

This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1 from scraped pages] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a department template context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools—specifically targeting infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while teaching interpersonal skills.[2][1 from scraped pages]

These concepts reflect an intentional element of OCPS's philosophy, positioned within broader efforts to create safe, inclusive learning environments and narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission. Restorative justice emphasizes counseling for underlying problems in a law enforcement-linked diversion program, while restorative practices prioritize proactive community-building and suspension reduction, signaling a shift toward relational, non-punitive discipline integrated into climate and culture strategies like Mentoring, MTSS, and PASS.[2][1 from scraped pages] They are conceptualized as tools for empowerment, resilience, and positive change rather than isolated mentions, aligning with district-wide commitments to mental health, student support, and productive school cultures.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond their placement under the Access and Opportunity department, which oversees related initiatives like Mentoring and School Support System without detailing restorative-specific roles or resources.[1 from scraped pages][2]

"# Restorative Justice at Orange County Public Schools: District-Level Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school culture framework. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and represent a formal, documented approach to student discipline and school climate management rather than isolated initiatives.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district webpages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a distinct departmental focus area under the Access and Opportunity division, indicating organizational recognition and structural placement.[4] The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most comprehensive description, positioning restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's broader commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as a proactive, relationship-centered approach to school discipline. According to the district's official description, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] The district emphasizes that restorative practices ensure ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[4] Specifically, the district targets ""key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" for reduction through these practices.[4] This represents a philosophical shift from purely punitive discipline toward addressing underlying causes of misbehavior through counseling and relationship-building, as evidenced by the Civil Citation program's focus on identifying ""troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1]

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support restorative practices. Restorative Practices is listed as a formal initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, which operates from 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[4] The district also employs specialized staff positions, including Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists who ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles.""[5] Additionally, the district has established partnerships with external organizations—OC Human Relations, Groundswell, and other community groups—to implement restorative practices across multiple schools, with documented success rates showing over 1,000 cases referred for restorative conflict resolution processes with an average resolution rate of 97%.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Little River Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide efforts to support student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Little River Elementary school website itself[2].

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the ""Civil Citation"" page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address root causes through counseling, integrated with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[2]. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under ""Access and Opportunity"" departments like Climate & Culture and PASS[1]; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without detailed context amid staff recognitions[1]; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect and insubordination in middle and high schools[2]. These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff profiles.

This presence suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for fostering positive school cultures and proactive discipline, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like mentoring and climate support[2]. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as relationship-focused tools for dialogue, growth, and suspension reduction, while restorative justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk students in partnership with law enforcement—indicating integration into behavioral and justice diversion strategies rather than peripheral or standalone elements[1][2].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's inclusion of restorative practices alongside mentoring and newsletters; the Civil Citation program implies operational collaboration but lacks further structural details[1][2].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Hidden Oaks Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, discipline alternatives, and positive school climates, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Hidden Oaks Elementary.[1][4]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal district program in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process, which diverts school-based incidents from traditional juvenile justice pathways—evident in instructions to filter dashboard data by ""School Based"" cases and participating agencies like OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity subheadings like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) indirectly via behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo's work at Dillard Street Elementary, though not explicitly linked; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building relationships, resolving conflicts through dialogue, enhancing responsibility, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect and altercations.[4] These are program descriptions and departmental listings, not policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, indicating operational rather than foundational emphasis.

This suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for fostering inclusive environments and resilience, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to ""narrow achievement gaps"" via safe, healthy school cultures—aligning restorative practices with initiatives like OCPS Mentoring (emphasizing traits such as empathy and perseverance) to promote collaboration over punishment.[4] The Civil Citation's restorative justice component reflects a rehabilitative lens on discipline, prioritizing counseling over punitive measures, while restorative practices are conceptualized as proactive tools for community-building and suspension reduction in middle/high schools, extending to interpersonal skills training.[1][4] However, mentions are peripheral, lacking evidence of district-wide philosophical integration or school-specific application at Hidden Oaks.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed: no staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs/centers (beyond Civil Citation integration), training initiatives, or organizational units are named explicitly for these terms.[1][4] Access and Opportunity oversees related efforts like Mentoring and Climate & Culture, but restorative practices appear as one initiative among others (e.g., MTSS, Vape Prevention), without implementation specifics.[4]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at Cypress Springs Elementary is not detailed in the available content.**

The terms appear exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Cypress Springs Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: as a menu item under the Access and Opportunity department on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map); briefly in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration; and substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is portrayed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4]

This usage indicates restorative justice and practices form a core element of the district's disciplinary and cultural philosophy, shifting from punitive measures toward proactive relationship-building, counseling, and collaborative problem-solving to foster resilience and inclusive environments. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is conceptualized as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while the Access and Opportunity page frames restorative practices as a district-supported strategy to narrow achievement gaps, promote healthy interactions, and teach conflict-resolution skills, aligning with broader goals like positive school cultures quoted from Solution Tree.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS, but without detailing roles, budgets, or school-level rollout.[4] The focus appears district-level and aspirational, especially for middle and high schools, with limited evidence of philosophy-to-practice connections at elementary levels like Cypress Springs.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Hunters Creek Middle School, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and cultural approaches, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the specific school level.[3][1 from scraped content]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Hunters Creek Middle School site itself. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address root causes through counseling, integrated into the Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[2 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity subpages, and is detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity) as a framework for building positive school cultures; a brief, incomplete mention also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid staff profiles.[3 from scraped content][1 from scraped content][4 from scraped content] These are program descriptions rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, serving as passing yet purposeful mentions within broader initiatives on student support and discipline alternatives.[3]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering positive, inclusive environments and reducing punitive measures, aligning with a philosophy that prioritizes relationships, dialogue, and root-cause intervention over traditional discipline. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes counseling for at-risk students in partnership with law enforcement, positioning it as a proactive alternative to citations.[2 from scraped content] **Restorative practices**, housed under the Access and Opportunity department, are described as a comprehensive framework to strengthen community relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically target reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—directly relevant to Hunters Creek Middle.[3] This reflects integration into the district's educational philosophy, linked to broader goals of resilience-building (e.g., via mentoring programs listing traits like empathy and responsible decision-making) and safe learning climates, rather than peripheral references.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details like staffing or protocols.[3] Similarly, the Stellar Award page mentions it tangentially without tying it to operations.[4 from scraped content] This scarcity limits assessment of practical rollout at Hunters Creek Middle or district-wide.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Hunters Creek Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Hunters Creek Elementary school website itself.[2] The term **restorative justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff listing without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2]

These terms reflect an intentional element of OCPS's philosophy on school climate and discipline, positioned within the district's Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive environments through relationship-building and proactive conflict skills training, rather than as peripheral mentions.[2] Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing root-cause resolution over traditional punishment,[1] while restorative practices embody a broader relational approach to community-building and suspension reduction, aligning with quotes on productive cultures where collaboration and learning from failures support teachers and students.[2] This suggests integration into the district's educational approach for behavior management, though not explicitly tied to core mission statements or universal policies across all schools.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity alongside mentoring and MTSS, but without implementation details like staffing or school-wide rollout.[2] The Stellar Award mention links it to a behavior specialist at another elementary school (Dillard St. Elementary), implying possible practitioner involvement, but no district-wide structure for Hunters Creek Elementary is evident.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Gotha Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though they are not presented as a district-wide philosophy or core policy[1][3].

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives[1]; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context without elaboration[1]; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect and insubordination, and teach interpersonal skills[3]. These are program descriptions rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with restorative justice tied to law enforcement collaboration and restorative practices linked to school climate efforts.

Content suggests restorative justice and practices are peripheral components of OCPS's philosophy, conceptualized as proactive tools for behavior intervention and culture-building rather than a transformative educational cornerstone. The district views restorative justice as a counseling-based diversion for at-risk students via Civil Citation[1], while restorative practices emphasize relationship maintenance, collaborative problem-solving, personal responsibility, and suspension reduction in middle and high schools to promote healthy interactions[3]. This aligns with broader Access and Opportunity goals of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, alongside initiatives like mentoring focused on resilience traits (e.g., empathy, grit)[1][3], but lacks evidence of deep philosophical integration across the district.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational departments solely for these practices; mentions remain descriptive without implementation details like staffing or training protocols[1][3].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Lake Whitney Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide efforts to address student behavior, build positive school cultures, and reduce disciplinary actions, though no school-specific implementation is detailed for Lake Whitney Elementary.[3][1 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation][2 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lake Whitney Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments,[2 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/site_map] in a Stellar Award finalist profile without direct explanation,[3 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/55601_4] and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page as a framework to foster positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[4 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity][3] These are program descriptions rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, indicating official district recognition but limited elaboration.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive and relational tools embedded in its educational philosophy, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps and promote resilience via traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance—aligning restorative practices with broader initiatives like mentoring and climate support.[4 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity] Restorative Justice functions as an alternative to traditional discipline for at-risk students, emphasizing counseling over punitive measures,[1 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation] while restorative practices are framed philosophically as comprehensive strategies for community-building and conflict resolution, integrated into school culture to prevent issues rather than merely react.[3] This suggests a district-wide philosophy favoring restorative methods to support student growth, though mentions are peripheral and high-level without evidence of deep philosophical centrality or school-level mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed under Access and Opportunity without detailing roles, budgets, or implementation structures, and the Stellar Award context highlights individual staff expertise peripherally without tying to formal systems.[1-4 from scraped content] The Civil Citation dashboard implies tracking mechanisms via law enforcement partnerships, but no OCPS-specific restorative centers or training programs are described.[1 from scraped content: https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering positive school cultures, with restorative practices explicitly tied to proactive community-building and suspension reduction, aligning with broader initiatives like mentoring that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance; Restorative Justice, in contrast, appears more targeted at external partnerships for counseling-based interventions rather than a standalone school philosophy.[2][1 from scraped pages] This suggests integration into the district's educational approach—particularly in climate, culture, and opportunity programs—rather than peripheral mentions, though it is not presented as a core mission statement element or universally applied across all grade levels, including elementary schools like Rosemont.[1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Discovery Middle School website itself. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2][1 from scraped content]

This usage positions restorative approaches within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than broad mission statements or policies; for instance, Civil Citation presents **Restorative Justice** as a proactive intervention alternative to traditional discipline, while Access and Opportunity conceptualizes **restorative practices** philosophically as tools for positive school cultures, proactive skill-building, and lower exclusionary discipline, aligning with quotes on collaborative, resilient environments.[2][1 from scraped content] These mentions suggest integration into the district's educational philosophy, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive climates and narrowing achievement gaps, though they remain somewhat peripheral without evidence of district-wide mandates or school-specific adoption at Discovery Middle.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed alongside broader efforts like OCPS Mentoring, PASS, MTSS, and Vape Prevention under Access and Opportunity, but without implementation specifics like staffing or protocols.[1 from scraped content][2] The Stellar Award recognition of behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo for interventions implies supportive practices in action, but not formalized restorative roles.[1 from scraped content]

"# Restorative Justice at Orange County Public Schools: Analysis of District-Level Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are clearly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-level approach to student discipline and school climate. These terms appear across multiple official district web pages and are integrated into the district's broader educational framework, though the available content does not provide evidence of implementation specifically at Southwood Elementary.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[3] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, positioning it within the district's organizational structure. The Stellar Award Finalists page mentions restorative practices in the context of teacher recognition, though without extensive detail. Most substantially, the Access and Opportunity Home page dedicates a section to ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions,"" providing the district's official conceptualization of the approach.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's Access and Opportunity department. The district defines restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while ""actively build[ing] community and promot[ing] healthy interactions between educators and students.""[3] This philosophy reflects a shift from purely punitive discipline toward addressing underlying causes of student misbehavior through relationship-building and conflict resolution.

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that restorative practices are housed within the district's Access and Opportunity department, which operates under the Student Services division. However, the provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, program names, training initiatives, or organizational structures directly related to restorative justice implementation at the district or school level. The district's partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department on the Civil Citation program suggests some infrastructure exists, but details are not provided in the available pages.

**Important Limitation**

Based on the available content from the district website, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is actively implemented at Southwood Elementary specifically. The content confirms that OCPS has adopted restorative practices as a district-level philosophy and framework, but provides no evidence of school-specific programs, staff, or initiatives at Southwood Elementary.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Sunrise Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and positive school climates, though no direct mentions occur on the Sunrise Elementary school website itself.[1][3]

The term **restorative justice** is explicitly referenced on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a formal partnership between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and local Police Department. This program targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events, positioning it as an alternative to traditional disciplinary measures for certain offenses.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while fostering community and interpersonal skills.[3]

These terms reflect integration into OCPS's broader educational philosophy, particularly through the **Access and Opportunity department**, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like mentoring, MTSS, and climate support. Restorative practices align with this by prioritizing collaborative problem-solving over punitive measures, echoing quotes on productive cultures where failures become learning experiences. Restorative justice, meanwhile, extends this philosophy into juvenile justice partnerships, conceptualizing justice as root-cause counseling rather than punishment. However, the mentions are program-specific rather than embedded in core mission statements or school-wide policies, suggesting a supportive rather than dominant role in daily operations.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; restorative practices falls under the general Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside mentoring and other supports like ICU, PASS, and Vape Prevention, but without assigned roles or implementation details. The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program implies operational collaboration with law enforcement, including dashboard tracking, yet lacks specifics on school-level rollout or training.[1][3]

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at student support, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no evidence indicates implementation specifically at Lakeville Elementary.[1][2]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Lakeville Elementary school site. ""Restorative justice"" appears once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a partnership program with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity resources, in a Stellar Award Finalists profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, serving as passing yet purposeful mentions in student support contexts.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive tools for discipline alternatives and cultural improvement, integrating restorative justice into civil citation processes for at-risk youth via law enforcement collaboration, and restorative practices into broader climate initiatives emphasizing dialogue, empathy, and reduced exclusionary discipline.[1][2] This suggests a philosophical commitment to rehabilitation over punishment, aligning with Access and Opportunity's goal of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, though mentions are peripheral rather than centrally embedded in core educational strategies like curricula or board policies.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units; restorative practices is listed alongside efforts like OCPS Mentoring, MTSS, and vape prevention under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details.[2] The Civil Citation program implies operational support through external agency dashboards but lacks internal school-based structures.[1]

On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices are defined as prioritizing strong relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and targeting reductions in suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, while proactively teaching interpersonal skills.[4][1 from scraped pages] Restorative Justice, in the Civil Citation context, shifts focus from punishment to counseling-based intervention for at-risk students.[1 from scraped pages] This suggests integration into the district's educational philosophy, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through healthy climates, though it appears more prominently as program descriptions and initiatives rather than core mission statements.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's umbrella initiatives like Mentoring and Restorative Practices. The Civil Citation program's partnership with law enforcement implies some operational support, but details on training, facilitators, or school-specific rollout are absent.[1 from scraped pages][4]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Riverdale Elementary / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary and school climate programs, though specific implementation at Riverdale Elementary is not detailed on the school website.[1][3]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated into the Civil Citation process—a diversionary alternative to juvenile justice involvement, with a dashboard for tracking school-based cases from agencies like Orlando Police Department and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity subtopics like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) with no direct context beyond listing; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity).[3] There, it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools. These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings.[1][3]

This content positions restorative approaches as integrated into the district's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to ""narrowing achievement gaps"" through safe, inclusive environments that foster collaboration and resilience. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize relational, dialogue-based strategies to prevent conflicts and teach interpersonal skills, aligning with broader goals like positive school cultures and reduced exclusionary discipline.[1][3] However, the references are peripheral rather than central, lacking evidence of district-wide mandates or philosophical primacy.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational centers. Restorative practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside efforts like OCPS Mentoring, but without details on staffing, training, or school-level rollout—especially for elementary sites like Riverdale.[3] The Stellar Award mention of behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary highlights interventions for students with autism but does not link to restorative methods.[3]

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school culture framework. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and represent formal initiatives rather than peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts across the OCPS website. First, on the Civil Citation page, OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in a program called ""Restorative Justice,"" which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues.[1] Second, Restorative Practices are featured prominently on the Access and Opportunity homepage, a dedicated district department focused on narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[1] Third, the terms appear in the district's site map navigation structure, indicating they are integrated into the organizational architecture of OCPS. Fourth, Restorative Practices are referenced in the context of recognizing exemplary educators, suggesting they are embedded in the district's educational culture and valued practices.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school discipline and culture. According to the district's official description, Restorative Practices are ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[1] The district emphasizes that a fundamental principle of this approach is ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[1] Specifically, OCPS aims to use Restorative Practices to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[1] This philosophy extends beyond conflict resolution to actively build community and promote healthy interactions between educators and students while teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.[1]

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support Restorative Practices implementation. The Access and Opportunity department serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando.[1] Additionally, OCPS has created specialized positions, including Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists through the Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) ACCESS Program, which serves at-risk youth throughout Orange County.[2] These specialists develop, plan, and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, conduct restorative circles, and collaborate with administration to develop comprehensive wellness programs while connecting with community outreach initiatives to reduce gang violence and risky behaviors.[2] The district also maintains partnerships with law enforcement agencies—including the Sheriff's Office, Police Department, and Orlando Police Department—to implement civil citation programs that identify troubled students for counseling interventions rather than traditional punitive measures.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Pinewood Elementary**

**Restorative Justice** is explicitly part of OCPS's approach through a dedicated program, while **restorative practices** form a key component of the district's broader strategy for positive school culture.[3] The district has partnered with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department to implement a **Restorative Justice** program under its Civil Citation initiative, which targets troubled students by using counseling to identify and address the root causes of their issues, as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice processes.[1] This is detailed on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it is presented as an official program with links to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like the Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1]

**Restorative practices** appear prominently in the Access and Opportunity department's resources, described as a ""comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" by prioritizing relationship-building, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and promoting personal responsibility through open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.[3] This initiative specifically aims to reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, while proactively teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future conflicts; it is listed alongside other efforts like mentoring under the department's key initiatives on https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity.[3] The term also surfaces in the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity subpages, signaling its integration into district navigation, and briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context, though without elaboration.[1]

These concepts reflect a core element of OCPS's educational philosophy, emphasizing positive, productive school cultures that support teacher and student success through collaboration, resilience-building, and addressing misbehavior's underlying causes rather than punitive measures alone.[3] **Restorative Justice** is framed as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while **restorative practices** align with the district's commitment to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity mission.[3] This philosophy connects directly to implementation, with restorative practices positioned to foster resilience traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance, mirroring statewide standards promoted in OCPS mentoring programs.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure—such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units—is detailed in the content for either term; mentions remain at the programmatic and departmental level without references to personnel, budgets, or training specifics.[1][3]

"# Restorative Justice at Lake George Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to school discipline and culture, though the available content does not provide specific information about implementation at Lake George Elementary itself. The terms appear consistently across OCPS district webpages, indicating these are established components of the district's educational framework rather than isolated initiatives.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four OCPS district webpages: the site map, the Civil Citation page, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a collaborative program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Access and Opportunity page provides the most substantive description, positioning restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's broader commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[3]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's Access and Opportunity department. The district conceptualizes these practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The philosophy emphasizes dialogue and shared responsibility: ""A core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, OCPS aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously ""building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students"" and ""teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.""[3]

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that restorative practices are administered through OCPS's Access and Opportunity department, which is listed as a key initiative within the district's organizational structure.[3] However, the provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, dedicated centers, training programs, or other implementation infrastructure at Lake George Elementary or within the broader district structure. The content references the existence of these practices but does not detail the personnel, facilities, or operational mechanisms through which they are delivered.

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Oakshire Elementary**

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** are part of the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary and cultural frameworks rather than a district-wide philosophy dominating all operations.[1][2] The term **Restorative Justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** appear on the Access and Opportunity department page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1] These terms also receive passing mentions on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under department listings and a Stellar Award page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), but without elaboration.[2]

These references position restorative approaches as components of official program descriptions and departmental initiatives, not core mission statements, policies, or staff profiles. For instance, the Civil Citation context ties Restorative Justice to diversionary counseling for juvenile issues, while Access and Opportunity emphasizes proactive community-building and suspension reduction through dialogue and skill-building.[1][2] No evidence suggests deep integration into the district's overarching educational philosophy; instead, they function peripherally within broader efforts like mental health services, resiliency instruction, behavioral supports, and mentoring, which prioritize safe environments and student success without centering restorative methods.[1][5][6]

The district conceptualizes these terms practically: Restorative Justice as a collaborative intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, and restorative practices as relationship-focused tools to minimize exclusions and teach conflict skills, aiming for growth over punishment.[1][2] This aligns with OCPS's Access and Opportunity goal of narrowing achievement gaps through inclusive cultures, but lacks details on systemic embedding across elementary schools like Oakshire.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content. There are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for restorative justice/practices. Related supports exist in behavioral teams, social services, and mentoring under Access and Opportunity, but they do not explicitly reference restorative elements.[1][5][8] Based on the available content, implementation details remain limited, preventing assessment of scale or efficacy at Oakshire Elementary or district-wide.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-level approach**, though the available content provides limited details on implementation specifics, with no mentions on the Corner Lake Middle School website itself.

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events[1][3]. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a fragmented context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[3]. These references position the terms within program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, serving as targeted mentions in disciplinary and equity-focused contexts.

This usage suggests **restorative justice and practices form a peripheral but intentional element of the district's philosophy**, conceptualized as proactive, relationship-centered alternatives to traditional punishment that emphasize counseling, dialogue, and community-building to foster resilience and lower exclusionary discipline. The Access and Opportunity department, which houses restorative practices alongside initiatives like mentoring (emphasizing traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance), reflects a broader commitment to safe, inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps through positive cultures[3]. However, the content does not indicate deep philosophical integration into core educational strategies, portraying these approaches more as supportive tools within disciplinary and wellness efforts than a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices appears as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details like staffing or metrics[3]. Similarly, the Stellar Award context lacks connection to restorative roles, focusing instead on general behavior specialists.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Meadow Woods Middle / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to school discipline and student support. However, the available content does not provide specific information about how these practices are implemented at Meadow Woods Middle School individually. The terms appear at the district level rather than at the individual school level.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across multiple OCPS district webpages, indicating they are integrated into the district's formal infrastructure. On the Civil Citation page, OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in a program called ""Restorative Justice,"" which ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Access and Opportunity department, a district-level initiative, features a dedicated section on ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions,"" positioning these practices as a comprehensive framework for middle and high schools.[3] Additionally, ""Restorative Practices"" appears in the district's site map under the Access and Opportunity department's key initiatives, suggesting it is an established, documented component of district operations.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the district content, restorative practices represent a philosophical shift away from purely punitive discipline toward relationship-building and conflict resolution. OCPS defines restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that ""prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that these practices ensure ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, OCPS targets ""school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while simultaneously ""building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students"" and teaching ""essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.""[3] This indicates that restorative practices are conceptualized as both a disciplinary alternative and a proactive community-building strategy.

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not provide specific information about dedicated staff positions, programs, or training initiatives at Meadow Woods Middle School. At the district level, OCPS has an Access and Opportunity department that oversees restorative practices implementation, and the district has partnered with external law enforcement agencies to support restorative justice efforts through civil citation programs.[1] However, the content does not identify specific coordinators, facilitators, or specialists assigned to Meadow Woods Middle, nor does it describe school-specific programs or training structures.

**Limitation**

Based on the available content from the OCPS district website, it is not possible to determine the specific implementation details, staffing, or program structure of restorative justice at Meadow Woods Middle School. The information confirms that restorative practices are part of the district's philosophy and approach but does not provide school-level details about how these practices are operationalized at this particular campus.

"Based on the available content from Orange County Public Schools' district website, **Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of the district's approach to school discipline and school culture**, though the specific implementation at Lawton Chiles Elementary is not detailed in the provided materials.

## Contextual Presence

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices appear across multiple district-level web pages, indicating institutional commitment rather than isolated initiatives. The terms appear on the district's site map under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, suggesting they are formally categorized within the district's organizational structure. Additionally, Restorative Justice is referenced on the district's Civil Citation page, where it is described as a partnership program between the Orange County School District, the Sheriff's Office, and the Police Department[3]. Restorative Practices are also featured on the Access and Opportunity homepage, which serves as a central hub for district initiatives focused on narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments[3].

## Philosophy and Conceptualization

The district conceptualizes Restorative Practices as **a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate positive school cultures and reduce suspensions**[3]. According to the district's official description, this approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools[3]. A core philosophical tenet is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts; the district emphasizes that by facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth[3]. The district specifically targets reductions in suspensions related to disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[3].

The Civil Citation program represents a distinct but complementary approach, where the district has partnered with law enforcement to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues[3].

## Infrastructure

The provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, programs, or training initiatives at Lawton Chiles Elementary. The district-level materials reference an ""Access and Opportunity"" department that oversees Restorative Practices as a key initiative, but no school-specific infrastructure, coordinators, or implementation details for Lawton Chiles Elementary are evident in the available content. To understand the specific infrastructure supporting Restorative Justice at this school, additional information from the school's website or direct contact with school administration would be necessary.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Northlake Park Community Elementary, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the individual school level is not detailed in the available content.[1][2]** 

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page, describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that targets troubled students through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools; and a Stellar Award finalist page highlighting a behavior specialist, though without direct linkage to the practices.[1][2] These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff listings, indicating targeted rather than pervasive mentions.[1][2]

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through proactive relationship-building and alternatives to exclusionary discipline**, as evidenced by their placement under the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience, and reduced suspensions.[1] The district conceptualizes Restorative Practices as a tool for collaborative problem-solving and community-building to prevent conflicts, aligning with broader resiliency efforts like mentoring programs listing traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making, while Restorative Justice focuses on counseling for at-risk students in a law enforcement partnership context.[1][2] However, the content does not indicate deep integration into core educational philosophy across all schools, appearing more as specialized initiatives than district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures explicitly tied to these practices; they are instead nested within the broader Access and Opportunity department, alongside efforts like mentoring and school support systems, without further details on implementation at Northlake Park Community Elementary.[1][2] Additional district pages on mental health, social services, and behavioral supports mention related concepts like crisis intervention and behavior management but do not reference restorative approaches directly.[5][7]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Orange County Public Schools District Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school climate. However, these terms appear to be implemented at the district level rather than as a school-specific initiative at Chain of Lakes Middle School. The district has established formal programs and infrastructure supporting these approaches across multiple schools.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district-level web pages, indicating their integration into OCPS's broader educational framework. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a collaborative program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This framing emphasizes early intervention and addressing underlying causes of student misbehavior rather than punitive responses.

On the Access and Opportunity departmental page, restorative practices receive more detailed treatment as part of the district's climate and culture initiatives. The page describes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" with the explicit goal of ""reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that these practices prioritize relationship-building and inclusive dialogue: ""A core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Additionally, the district identifies specific infractions targeted by restorative practices: ""disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[3]

The terms also appear in the site map under the Access and Opportunity department's key initiatives, confirming their official status within district organizational structure. A reference to restorative practices appears in the Stellar Award Finalists content, though in this context it serves as background context rather than a primary focus.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices represent a philosophical shift in OCPS's approach to student discipline. Rather than relying solely on exclusionary discipline (suspension and expulsion), the district has adopted a reconciliation-focused model that seeks to understand root causes of misbehavior and facilitate dialogue between affected parties. The district's philosophy centers on building community and maintaining relationships while addressing behavioral issues. This approach aligns with the broader district commitment to ""narrowing achievement gaps by fostering an environment conducive to learning"" through ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments.""[3]

The integration of restorative practices into the Access and Opportunity department—which focuses on school climate, culture, and student support—indicates that the district views these practices as fundamental to its educational mission rather than as a peripheral program.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative justice and restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative within this department's portfolio, alongside mentoring programs and other climate-focused work.

The district also partners with external law enforcement agencies—the Sheriff's Office and Police Department—to implement the Restorative Justice program, which includes a Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based cases.[1] This partnership structure suggests a coordinated, multi-agency approach to identifying and supporting at-risk students.

However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists assigned to individual schools, nor does it detail training programs or implementation timelines specific to Chain of Lakes Middle School.

This usage positions restorative approaches as a core element of OCPS's philosophy within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by fostering safe, healthy, inclusive environments via initiatives like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance) and climate/culture support; restorative practices are conceptualized here as proactive tools for relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and lowering exclusionary discipline, aligning with broader district efforts like the Civil Citation program for diversionary counseling.[2][5] While not tied to mission statements or school-specific policies for Sheeler High Charter, these descriptions indicate philosophical integration into district educational strategies rather than peripheral mentions, with restorative practices promoted as a means to empower change and teach interpersonal skills proactively.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation and general Access and Opportunity initiatives, training details, or organizational structures; trained school staff (administrators, teachers, counselors) are noted generically as facilitators for restorative circles, but without titles or dedicated roles specified.[2][5] Mentoring is highlighted under Access and Opportunity with a contact (Christopher Ludwig), but it focuses on resilience rather than restorative-specific training.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Avalon Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide efforts to support student behavior, reduce discipline issues, and foster positive school cultures, though specific implementation at Avalon Elementary is not detailed in the available content.

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and uses counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives like Mentoring and PASS; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief staff listing context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, positioning them as supportive tools within broader climate and culture efforts.

This indicates restorative approaches are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as proactive strategies for positive school environments and discipline alternatives, conceptualized as relationship-focused methods that emphasize dialogue, accountability, and growth over punitive measures—exemplified by the Civil Citation's counseling for root causes and Access and Opportunity's suspension reduction goals. However, the content provides limited depth, with restorative justice as a law enforcement-linked intervention and restorative practices as a cultural framework, suggesting peripheral rather than core philosophical embedding without evidence of district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation and general Access and Opportunity initiatives, training details, or organizational structures; restorative practices are listed alongside Mentoring and other supports like ICU, MTSS, and Vape Prevention, but without implementation specifics for Avalon Elementary or elementary levels.[1][3]

"# Restorative Justice in Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are clearly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach to student discipline and school climate. The district explicitly incorporates these frameworks into its official policies and programs, as evidenced by their presence across multiple district web pages and departmental initiatives.[2]

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in several distinct contexts across OCPS's web infrastructure. On the Civil Citation page, ""Restorative Justice"" is presented as a formal partnership program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] This positions Restorative Justice as an official district initiative integrated with law enforcement agencies.

""Restorative Practices"" appears more prominently in the district's Access and Opportunity department, which is responsible for fostering safe and inclusive learning environments. The term is listed among key initiatives on the department's homepage and receives dedicated programmatic attention.[2] Additionally, Restorative Practices is referenced in the district's site map under the Access and Opportunity section, indicating it is an established departmental focus area rather than a peripheral mention.[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices function as a core philosophical framework within OCPS's approach to school climate and discipline. According to the district's official description, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2]

The district emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[2] The district specifically targets ""school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" through this framework.[2] This demonstrates that Restorative Practices are integrated into the district's educational philosophy rather than serving as an ancillary program.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support Restorative Practices implementation. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the primary administrative hub for these initiatives, with a contact number provided (407-317-3200 x 2003470).[2] This department oversees multiple key initiatives, including Restorative Practices alongside mentoring programs and other school climate initiatives.

The district's Restorative Justice program operates through partnerships with external agencies, including the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, creating a coordinated infrastructure that extends beyond school boundaries.[2] However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated Restorative Justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists at individual school sites, nor does it detail formal training programs or centers specifically named for Restorative Justice within OCPS.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing BETA, integrates restorative justice and restorative practices into its disciplinary and cultural approaches, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.** Restorative justice appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page as a partnered program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, linking to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events[1 from query content]. Restorative practices are mentioned on the site map under Access and Opportunity, on the Stellar Award Finalists page amid recognition of staff contributions to school culture, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where they are framed as a **comprehensive framework** to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[3][query content].

These terms are embedded in official program descriptions rather than passing mentions or staff listings: restorative justice ties directly to a civil citation initiative as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses, while restorative practices form a key initiative within the district's **Access and Opportunity department**, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures[query content]. This suggests integration into the district's educational philosophy, conceptualized as proactive tools for community-building, empathy-driven dialogue, and resilience over punitive measures, aligning with broader goals like mentoring programs that emphasize traits such as self-awareness, grit, and responsible decision-making[query content].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), training programs, centers, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these practices; mentions remain at the programmatic level without evidence of named roles or facilities[query content]. Consequently, while restorative approaches appear philosophically aligned with fostering productive school cultures and reducing exclusions, the content lacks sufficient detail to assess full-scale implementation or centrality to daily operations.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Odyssey Middle/Orange**

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at student support, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Odyssey Middle School.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal district program in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events, positioning it as an alternative to traditional disciplinary measures for qualifying incidents.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which highlights them peripherally amid behavior specialist achievements but provides no details; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, restorative practices are described as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—explicitly linking to proactive skill-building for healthier interactions.[2]

These references suggest **restorative justice** and practices form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience. Civil Citation's restorative justice emphasizes root-cause counseling over punishment, aligning with restorative principles of reconciliation, while Access and Opportunity conceptualizes practices as relationship-centered tools for dialogue and reduced exclusions, quoted from Solution Tree on productive cultures where failures become learning opportunities. However, they appear more as program descriptions within support departments than core elements of district-wide policies, mission statements, or school-specific implementations—no mentions occur on the Odyssey Middle School website itself.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond their placement under Access and Opportunity (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) and linkages to mentoring/resiliency initiatives listing traits like empathy and responsible decision-making. Related efforts like OCPS Mentoring and School Support System are noted alongside restorative practices on department pages, implying integration into a support ecosystem, but without explicit training, staffing, or metrics provided.[2]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Olympia High School in Orange County, Florida, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.[3][1 from scraped pages]** These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Olympia High School website itself. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[2 from scraped pages] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award Finalists page amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1][3][4 from scraped pages]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements or staff listings, suggesting an intentional but not centrally philosophical integration into the district's educational approach. Restorative Justice functions as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement collaboration, emphasizing counseling over traditional punishment,[2 from scraped pages] while Restorative Practices aligns with a proactive philosophy of positive, productive school cultures that prioritize collaboration, resilience, and learning from failures, as quoted from Solution Tree on the Access and Opportunity page.[4 from scraped pages] Together, they reflect a shift toward relationship-focused discipline to narrow achievement gaps and maintain safe, inclusive environments, though they appear more as specific initiatives than a district-wide overhaul.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, or centers; Restorative Practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which builds resilience traits including empathy and responsible decision-making, but without explicit links to restorative staff or structures.[4 from scraped pages] The Civil Citation program's dashboard implies some tracking mechanism, but no personnel or training specifics are provided.[2 from scraped pages] Overall, while these practices are part of the district's toolkit for school climate and discipline, the content offers only high-level descriptions without evidence of robust implementation details, programs, or school-specific application at Olympia High.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Eagles Nest Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted district-wide initiatives focused on student behavior intervention and positive school culture, though specific implementation at Eagles Nest Elementary is not detailed in the available content.[3]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, positioning them as supportive tools within broader climate and culture efforts.

This suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement under the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[3] The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a counseling-based diversion for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize proactive relationship-building, dialogue, and suspension reduction to teach interpersonal skills—indicating a philosophy that prioritizes root-cause addressing over punitive measures, though integration appears more programmatic than deeply embedded across all schools.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like mentoring and MTSS without further implementation details.[3]

The district conceptualizes these approaches philosophically as proactive tools for fostering inclusive, resilient environments that emphasize collaboration, empathy, and growth over punitive measures, aligning with quotes on productive school cultures where failures become learning experiences.[4] Restorative Practices, in particular, is integrated into the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps by maintaining safe, healthy learning spaces, suggesting a core educational philosophy rather than peripheral mentions.[4] However, Restorative Justice seems more narrowly applied to external partnerships for civil citations, indicating targeted rather than school-wide adoption.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for West Oaks Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[2] These terms are mentioned on four specific district website pages: ""Civil Citation"" describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events;[1] ""Access and Opportunity Home"" details **restorative practices** as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations;[2] the ""Site Map"" lists **restorative practices** under the Access and Opportunity department alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring;[1] and ""Stellar Award Finalists"" (page 55601_4) references **restorative practices** peripherally in a staff profile context, though without elaboration.[1] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff assignments.

The content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments via positive school cultures, resilience-building traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility, perseverance), and reduced exclusionary discipline.[2] **Restorative Justice** is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in collaboration with law enforcement, shifting from punitive measures to root-cause resolution.[1] **Restorative practices** emphasize relationship-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts and promote growth, aligning with broader goals like mentoring and climate improvement, though primarily targeted at middle and high schools rather than elementary levels like West Oaks.[2] This suggests a district-wide philosophy favoring restorative over traditional discipline, but implementation details remain high-level without evidence of universal adoption across all schools.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further structural details like personnel or rollout plans.[2] Similarly, the Stellar Award page highlights behavior specialists but does not link them explicitly to restorative roles.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at West Creek Elementary is not detailed in the available content.** These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the West Creek Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events[1][4]. ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: on the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), in a Stellar Award finalist profile without direct context (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[1][4].

This usage positions restorative approaches as integral to OCPS's philosophy of fostering safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement within the Access and Opportunity department's key initiatives alongside mentoring and resilience-building efforts. The Civil Citation program's restorative justice component reflects a rehabilitative rather than punitive response to student issues, while restorative practices are conceptualized district-wide as proactive tools for community-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts[1][4]. However, these mentions are program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or school-specific mandates, suggesting a district-level philosophy that may influence but is not explicitly tied to West Creek Elementary's operations.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational structures solely for restorative justice; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or school-level rollout[1].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Timber Creek High School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives[1][4]. These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, with no references found on the Timber Creek High School website. Specifically, **restorative justice** appears on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. **Restorative practices** is referenced on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect and insubordination, and foster relationships through dialogue and accountability[4].

These mentions position restorative approaches as components of official district program descriptions rather than broad policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with examples including counseling in Civil Citation for juvenile diversion and restorative practices as a key initiative to lower middle and high school suspension rates by promoting empathy, responsibility, and conflict resolution[1][4]. While not central to a district-wide philosophy explicitly stated across pages, they align with OCPS's emphasis on safe, inclusive environments and resilience-building, as seen in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps via positive cultures and related efforts like mentoring[4]. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as proactive relationship-building and reactive conflict resolution tools that empower students and staff, aiming to decrease punitive discipline and teach interpersonal skills, though restorative justice is more narrowly tied to law enforcement collaborations for at-risk youth[1][4].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices is listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like MTSS, mentoring, and vape prevention without further implementation details[4]. The available content provides limited depth, focusing on high-level descriptions rather than operational evidence, making it challenging to assess full integration at Timber Creek High School specifically.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Citrus Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives aimed at addressing student behavior through counseling, relationship-building, and conflict resolution rather than solely punitive measures.[2][1 from scraped content]

The term **Restorative Justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1 from scraped content] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a passing reference amid behavior specialist profiles; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2][1 from scraped content]

These concepts appear embedded in OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive, productive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[2] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, shifting from traditional discipline to root-cause counseling.[1 from scraped content] Restorative practices extend this into a school-wide educational tool for community-building, proactive conflict prevention, and skill development in interpersonal relations, aligning with quotes emphasizing collective improvement and support over punishment.[2] While not positioned as a core district-wide policy or mission statement centerpiece, they integrate into climate and culture efforts, suggesting philosophical commitment to restorative over exclusionary approaches, though mentions remain program-specific rather than universally mandated.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, or centers; restorative practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, but without specified staff roles or implementation structures.[2] The Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice relies on law enforcement partnerships without internal OCPS staffing mentioned.[1 from scraped content] A behavior specialist like Lauren Fiallo at Dillard Street Elementary is highlighted for interventions, but not explicitly tied to restorative roles.[1 from scraped content] Overall, infrastructure appears departmental and partnership-based, lacking evident school-level programs or training details.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Freedom High School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.**[2][1 from query]

Restorative Justice appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department; this initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[query: civil-citation page] Restorative Practices is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which highlights it indirectly through staff achievements in behavior management; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[query: accessopportunity page][2][query: site_map][query: 55601_4 page] These references position the terms within program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with no mentions on the Freedom High School website itself.

This usage suggests Restorative Justice and Practices form part of OCPS's broader philosophy on school climate and discipline, shifting from punitive measures toward relational and proactive strategies, as seen in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on safe, inclusive environments and reduced suspensions alongside related efforts like mentoring and resiliency traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility).[query: accessopportunity page][2] However, the mentions are somewhat peripheral, lacking evidence of district-wide mandates or philosophical centrality, and appear more as targeted tools within support systems than a fully integrated educational pillar.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; Restorative Practices is listed under Access and Opportunity without detailing roles or structures, and other pages offer only passing navigational or exemplary references.[query: all pages][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Wekiva High School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though no specific mentions occur on the Wekiva High School website itself.[3][1 from scraped content]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, not the school site. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (amid profiles of educators like behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo, without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, framed as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][2 from scraped content][4 from scraped content]

This indicates integration into the district's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive school cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree on fostering collaboration and learning from failures. Restorative practices are conceptualized district-wide as proactive tools for community-building, conflict resolution, and skill development to prevent future issues, while restorative justice functions as a diversionary counseling intervention tied to law enforcement for at-risk students, suggesting a blend of reactive and preventive strategies rather than peripheral references.[3][1 from scraped content]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; mentions remain descriptive without implementation specifics like staffing or protocols.[1 from scraped content][3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Millennia Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the specific implementation at Millennia Elementary itself is not detailed in the available content.[1][2]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Millennia Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into a Civil Citation process tracked via a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** are referenced more broadly: on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside climate, culture, and MTSS; on the Access and Opportunity home page as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools; and peripherally on a Stellar Award Finalists page without elaboration.[2][3][4]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than core mission statements or staff listings, indicating a structured disciplinary alternative rather than a passing mention. The district conceptualizes **Restorative Justice** as a counseling-focused intervention for at-risk students in collaboration with law enforcement, while **restorative practices** emphasize proactive relationship-building, dialogue-driven problem-solving, and skill development to minimize exclusions, aligning with broader goals of inclusive, resilient school environments that include traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[2][5]

Evidence suggests these approaches form part of the district's educational philosophy, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, healthy cultures via initiatives like mentoring and restorative practices—framed as essential for collaboration, learning from failures, and faculty support.[2] They are not merely peripheral but actively promoted to shift from punitive measures toward accountability and growth, though primarily targeted at middle and high schools with elementary applications implied through district-wide policies.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed in the scraped content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs; restorative practices are facilitated by trained general staff like administrators, teachers, or counselors, and Restorative Justice operates via partnerships without specified internal roles.[1][2] The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees related efforts, including restorative practices and OCPS Mentoring, but lacks mention of specialized positions or standalone programs.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Westbrook Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and discipline alternatives, though no school-specific details for Westbrook Elementary are evident.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief staff context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, indicating programmatic rather than foundational emphasis.

Content suggests restorative practices align with OCPS's broader philosophy of fostering safe, inclusive environments to narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's purpose of supporting positive, productive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building.[2] Restorative justice is conceptualized more narrowly as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices represent a proactive, relationship-centered approach to discipline and community-building, integrated into initiatives like mentoring that emphasize traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[2] However, these elements appear as supporting tools within student support systems rather than a core, district-wide educational philosophy, with no evidence of deep integration across all schools or grade levels.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details, and mentions on other pages are passing or navigational.[1][2]

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Moss Park Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools district's approach to school discipline and student support, though the available content does not indicate that Moss Park Elementary specifically implements these programs. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on the school's individual website, suggesting these are district-wide initiatives that may or may not be active at all individual schools.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity home page.[2][4] On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[2] On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices are described as a key initiative under the district's broader commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[4] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a distinct departmental focus area within the Access and Opportunity division, indicating it has an organizational home within the district structure.[1] These references suggest restorative approaches are integrated into official district policy and programming rather than mentioned peripherally.

**Philosophy Assessment**

The Orange County Public Schools district conceptualizes restorative practices as a comprehensive framework for cultivating positive school cultures and reducing suspensions.[4] The district's philosophy emphasizes relationship-building and collaborative problem-solving: ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[4] The district specifically targets suspensions related to disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, aiming to address these infractions through dialogue and accountability rather than exclusionary discipline.[4] This reflects a philosophical commitment to understanding root causes of student behavior and building community responsibility.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department houses a dedicated Restorative Practices initiative, indicating this is a formal departmental function within the district's student services structure.[4] The district has also created a Civil Citation program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, which serves as a mechanism for identifying troubled students and providing counseling interventions.[2] However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated staff positions (such as restorative justice coordinators or facilitators), specialized centers, or training programs at the district or school level. The content does not clarify whether Moss Park Elementary has implemented restorative practices or whether it participates in these district-level initiatives.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Sand Lake Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at student support, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no direct mentions occur on the Sand Lake Elementary school website itself.[2][1 from query]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from query] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, on a Stellar Award Finalists page amid recognitions of staff contributions (without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2][1 from query]

This usage positions restorative approaches as integral to the district's philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support productive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building. OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as proactive relationship-focused strategies that teach interpersonal skills and empower change, distinct from but complementary to restorative justice's counseling-oriented diversion for disciplinary issues; however, the mentions are program-descriptive rather than embedded in overarching mission statements or policies, suggesting philosophical alignment without evidence of district-wide mandates.[2][1 from query]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's broad umbrella, which encompasses restorative practices alongside initiatives like mentoring, MTSS, and vape prevention; the Civil Citation program's restorative justice operates via external law enforcement partnerships without internal OCPS staffing specified.[1 from query][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Castle Creek Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted district initiatives focused on student support, conflict resolution, and positive school climates, though no specific mentions tie directly to Castle Creek Elementary itself.[3][1 from scraped pages]

The terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no occurrences on the Castle Creek Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without detailed context amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][2 from scraped pages]

These references suggest restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's mission to support positive school cultures through collaboration and resilience-building. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a diversionary counseling intervention for disciplinary issues, while restorative practices emphasize proactive community-building and dialogue to minimize exclusions, aligning with district goals like those in OCPS Mentoring, which promotes traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance. However, the mentions are program-descriptive or navigational rather than embedded in core policies, mission statements, or school-wide mandates, indicating peripheral rather than fully integrated application across all levels, particularly for elementary schools like Castle Creek.[3][1 from scraped pages]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's umbrella initiatives like Restorative Practices and OCPS Mentoring. The Civil Citation program's collaboration with law enforcement implies some operational support, but lacks specifics on implementation at individual schools.[1 from scraped pages][3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, particularly through targeted programs and initiatives aimed at improving student behavior and school climate, though specific implementation at Wolf Lake Middle School is not detailed in the available content.[2][4]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a district program developed in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department; this initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which frames it as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—especially for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools; and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which lists it alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts without further elaboration.[1][4] These references occur in official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, indicating structured but not deeply detailed mentions.

This content suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form a peripheral yet intentional component of the district's philosophy**, conceptualized as proactive tools for fostering resilience, empathy, and community while diverting from punitive discipline; for instance, they align with broader Access and Opportunity goals of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and traits like self-management, responsible decision-making, and perseverance.[4] However, they are not presented as a core, school-wide educational pillar or fully integrated strategy, appearing more as specialized interventions tied to behavior support and suspension reduction rather than universal practice.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational departments explicitly for these practices—Restorative Practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without details on implementation, and no mentions tie directly to Wolf Lake Middle School.[1][2][4]

"Based on the available content provided, **Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' district-wide approach**, though the specific implementation at Wyndham Lakes Elementary cannot be determined from the materials supplied.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms appear on four district-level web pages rather than on school-specific content. On the Civil Citation page, the district describes a partnership program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The site map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a component within the Access and Opportunity department. Most substantially, the Access and Opportunity homepage provides detailed information about restorative practices as a key initiative, describing them as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment.""[3]

## Philosophy Assessment

Restorative Practices represent a deliberate philosophical shift within the district's approach to school discipline and culture. The district frames these practices as addressing ""the ineffectiveness and disproportionality that arises in more traditional school discipline systems.""[2] The philosophy emphasizes relationship-building and conflict resolution over exclusionary discipline, with the stated goal of ""reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district prioritizes ensuring ""that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, the district aims to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[3]

## Infrastructure

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support restorative practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the administrative hub and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] However, the provided content does not identify dedicated staff positions, specific restorative justice centers, or training programs by name at the district or school level. The district also operates a Restorative Justice program in partnership with law enforcement agencies and maintains a Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based cases, though detailed program structure is not described in the available materials.

## Limitation

The content does not provide sufficient information to determine whether Restorative Justice infrastructure or programming is specifically implemented at Wyndham Lakes Elementary or how the school applies these district-level frameworks in its daily operations.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing South Creek Middle School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the school level.**[2][1 from scraped pages]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address root causes through counseling, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[scraped content: civil-citation] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), listing it alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which briefly notes it in a navigation context without elaboration; and the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[scraped content: all pages][2] These references position the terms within program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, with no mentions on the South Creek Middle School website itself.

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for creating supportive, inclusive environments that prioritize root-cause intervention over punitive measures**, aligning with broader goals of narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining safe learning spaces, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on positive cultures and reduced suspensions.[scraped content: accessopportunity][2] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and skill-teaching to prevent conflicts, while Restorative Justice targets counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, indicating a shift toward relational and rehabilitative discipline integrated into student support systems like Civil Citation. However, the mentions are not deeply embedded in core educational philosophy statements, appearing more as targeted initiatives than district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; Restorative Practices is simply listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or metrics.[scraped content: all pages] The Civil Citation program implies some operational support through inter-agency collaboration, but lacks specifics on school-level rollout at South Creek Middle or elsewhere.

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate approach. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and are presented as formal initiatives rather than peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts across the OCPS district website. First, on the Civil Citation page, ""Restorative Justice"" is presented as a formal program: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This framing positions Restorative Justice as a collaborative, law enforcement-integrated initiative focused on addressing underlying causes of student behavior rather than purely punitive responses.

Second, ""Restorative Practices"" appears on the district's site map within the ""Access and Opportunity"" department structure, indicating it is an organized departmental initiative.[2] Third, the term appears in the Stellar Award Finalists page, though in this context it serves as background context for recognizing educators who implement specialized interventions.[3] Fourth, and most substantially, ""Restorative Practices"" is featured as a key initiative on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it receives dedicated programmatic description.[2]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as a comprehensive framework. According to the district's official description, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment. This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] The district emphasizes that ""a core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[2]

The district specifically identifies that ""Restorative Practices aim to significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[2] Beyond conflict resolution, the framework is presented as actively building community and promoting healthy interactions between educators and students while teaching essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.[2] This represents a philosophical shift from exclusionary discipline toward restorative approaches that address root causes.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support these initiatives. The ""Access and Opportunity"" department serves as the administrative home for Restorative Practices, with a contact person identified for the mentoring component (Christopher Ludwig).[2] The Orange County Department of Education (OCDE) has created positions such as ""Restorative Justice & Wellness Specialist,"" which involves developing, planning, and facilitating restorative justice and school wellness programs, conducting restorative circles, and collaborating with administration to develop comprehensive wellness programs.[3] Additionally, the district has established resources and guidance materials for implementation, including matrices to guide school-wide implementation of restorative practices and research documentation of effectiveness.[5]

The district's partnership with law enforcement agencies (Sheriff's Office and Police Department) through the Civil Citation program represents another structural element, creating a coordinated approach to identifying and supporting troubled students.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Stone Lakes Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Stone Lakes Elementary.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[1] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or school-specific content, positioning them as supportive tools within broader climate and opportunity efforts.[1][2]

This usage suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to positive school cultures through collaboration, resilience-building, and reduced exclusionary discipline.[1] The district conceptualizes restorative practices as proactive relationship-building and dialogue-based conflict resolution to teach interpersonal skills and prevent future issues, while restorative justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, indicating a blend of therapeutic and community-oriented discipline over punitive measures.[1][2] However, the peripheral nature of these references—lacking integration into core strategic plans or elementary-specific applications—implies they are not centrally embedded across all schools but rather selective tools within support frameworks.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond Civil Citation and Access and Opportunity initiatives, training details, or organizational units solely for these practices; mentions are instead nested under general departments like Access and Opportunity, with contacts like Christopher Ludwig for related resilience efforts but no restorative-specific roles.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Sunset Park Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[3] These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, with no references on the Sunset Park Elementary school website: ""restorative justice"" on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events;[1] ""restorative practices"" on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity subpages, and explicitly on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and a passing reference on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration.[3]

These mentions position restorative approaches as integrated elements of OCPS's philosophy on school climate and discipline, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps by fostering safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like restorative practices alongside mentoring.[3] The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in collaboration with law enforcement, diverting from traditional punitive measures, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and proactive skill-building to prevent conflicts and lower suspension rates, aligning with broader goals of resilience, empathy, and positive cultures quoted from Solution Tree.[3] This suggests a philosophical shift toward restorative methods as core to productive, collaborative school environments, though primarily highlighted for middle and high schools rather than elementary levels like Sunset Park.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further implementation details, and the Civil Citation program lacks specifics on staffing or scope.[3] The available content provides limited depth, focusing on high-level descriptions rather than operational evidence of widespread adoption or evaluation at Sunset Park Elementary or district-wide.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no references on the Legacy High Charter school website itself. **Restorative Justice** is specifically described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into the Civil Citation process tracked via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[civil-citation] **Restorative practices**, mentioned three times, appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (without direct elaboration), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[accessopportunity][site_map][55601_4]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than broad mission statements or staff listings; for instance, Restorative Practices is listed alongside efforts like mentoring and MTSS under Access and Opportunity, which focuses on safe, inclusive environments to narrow achievement gaps.[accessopportunity] The Civil Citation context frames **Restorative Justice** as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses, emphasizing counseling over punitive measures.[civil-citation]

**Restorative Justice** and practices appear peripherally integrated into OCPS's philosophy of positive school culture and discipline reform, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, conflict resolution, and suspension reduction rather than a standalone centerpiece. The Access and Opportunity page explicitly ties restorative practices to collaborative problem-solving and teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues, aligning with a broader commitment to resilience traits like empathy and responsibility via mentoring.[accessopportunity] However, without evidence of district-wide mandates or Legacy High-specific adoption, it remains a targeted initiative rather than a core, fully embedded educational philosophy.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), with no further details on implementation, staffing, or school-level rollout.[accessopportunity] This limits insight into practical application at Legacy High Charter.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Legacy Middle School, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.[3][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Legacy Middle School site itself. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices**, mentioned on the site map under Access and Opportunity departments and detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page, are framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[4 from scraped pages][3 from search] A passing reference also appears on a Stellar Award Finalists page in the context of school support systems, without elaboration.[3 from scraped pages] These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff profiles.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to shifting from punitive measures toward proactive, relationship-based strategies that enhance school climate, resilience, and equity, suggesting philosophical integration into its educational framework—particularly via the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps. Restorative Justice emphasizes counseling for underlying problems in a law enforcement-linked diversion program, while restorative practices prioritize dialogue, community-building, and suspension reduction to teach interpersonal skills and prevent future conflicts, aligning with broader goals like mentoring and positive cultures quoted from Solution Tree.[4 from scraped pages]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's listing of restorative practices alongside initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention; the Civil Citation program implies collaboration with external agencies but lacks internal details.[1][2][4 from scraped pages] This leaves implementation specifics unclear from the scraped pages alone.

This usage suggests Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to positive school cultures through collaboration, resilience-building, and reduced exclusionary discipline.[3] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive community-building and reactive conflict resolution to teach interpersonal skills and prevent future issues, while Restorative Justice emphasizes counseling for at-risk students in a law enforcement-linked diversion program.[1][3] However, the content portrays these as peripheral mentions within broader initiatives rather than a centrally integrated educational philosophy, with no evidence of school-specific adoption at Bridgewater Middle.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Avalon Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, conflict resolution, and positive school culture, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Avalon Middle School.[1][2] The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a truncated context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2]

These references position restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's broader philosophy of fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through the **Access and Opportunity department**, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience-building, and alternatives to traditional discipline.[2] Restorative practices align with this by prioritizing collaborative problem-solving and healthy interactions over punitive measures, echoing quotes on productive cultures where failures become learning experiences.[2] However, **restorative justice** seems more peripherally linked to external law enforcement collaborations for civil citations, while restorative practices represent a proactive educational strategy, though neither is framed in mission statements, official policies, or school-specific plans based on the scraped content.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures explicitly for restorative approaches; mentions remain descriptive without implementation details like training protocols or school-wide rollout.[1][2] The Access and Opportunity department lists restorative practices alongside initiatives like mentoring and newsletters but provides no evidence of dedicated roles or centers.[2]

The terms appear exclusively on four pages of the OCPS district website, with no mentions on the East Lake Elementary school website. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is presented as a key initiative.[2] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, positioning restorative approaches as supportive tools within broader equity and discipline frameworks.

This usage indicates that restorative justice and practices form part of OCPS's philosophy for fostering positive school cultures, emphasizing relationship-building, conflict resolution through dialogue, personal responsibility, and reduced suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] The district conceptualizes restorative practices as a comprehensive framework to ensure all voices are heard, promote healthy interactions, and teach interpersonal skills proactively, aligning with resilience-building traits like empathy and responsible decision-making listed under OCPS Mentoring.[2] While integrated into the Access and Opportunity department's mission of narrowing achievement gaps via safe, inclusive environments, the mentions are somewhat peripheral, lacking evidence of school-wide mandates or deep philosophical embedding at the elementary level like East Lake.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation and general Access and Opportunity initiatives, training details, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed alongside efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention without further implementation specifics.[2]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Andover Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures.[2 from scraped pages][3]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering safe, inclusive environments and reducing suspensions, particularly in middle and high schools, rather than peripheral mentions. On the Access and Opportunity page, **restorative practices** prioritize strong relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and targeting reductions in suspensions for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while teaching interpersonal skills proactively.[3] The Civil Citation program's **Restorative Justice** emphasizes counseling over punitive measures for at-risk students, signaling a shift toward root-cause intervention.[1 from scraped pages] This aligns with the department's broader philosophy of narrowing achievement gaps through positive cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree: productive schools collaborate for the common good and treat failures as learning experiences.[2 from scraped pages] However, the content does not indicate full philosophical integration across all schools, such as in mission statements or universal policies, and lacks specifics on Andover Elementary's adoption.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, including staff positions like coordinators or specialists, named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures explicitly tied to these practices at Andover Elementary or district-wide. The Access and Opportunity department oversees related efforts like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making) alongside restorative practices, but without detailing implementation mechanisms.[2 from scraped pages] Stellar Award recognition of staff like behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary hints at aligned behavioral interventions, such as specialized plans for students with autism, but does not directly link to restorative frameworks.[3 from scraped pages] Overall, while philosophy points toward proactive, relationship-based discipline, the content offers insufficient evidence of robust infrastructure or school-specific application.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Prosperitas Leadership Academy Charter**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives within the district's discipline and school climate strategies, though specific implementation at Prosperitas Leadership Academy Charter is not detailed in the available content.

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events involving agencies like the Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which frames it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools; and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which notes it peripherally in a department context without elaboration. These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, staff listings, or policies, serving as practical tools for discipline diversion and climate improvement.

Content suggests restorative practices align with OCPS's philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments that narrow achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on positive, productive school cultures through collaboration, relationship-building, and problem-solving. Restorative justice complements this by shifting from punitive measures to counseling-focused interventions for at-risk students, indicating philosophical integration into the district's educational approach via the Access and Opportunity framework, which also includes related efforts like mentoring (emphasizing resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance) and initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and PASS. The district conceptualizes these terms as proactive strategies for conflict resolution—using methods like open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving to enhance accountability and reduce exclusions—rather than peripheral mentions.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative justice coordinators), named programs or centers beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or distinct organizational structures; restorative practices are facilitated district-wide by trained school staff including administrators, teachers, or counselors, but without named roles or specialized units detailed here.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Aloma High Charter**

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** form part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and cultural approach, with **Restorative Justice** implemented through a specific partnership program and **restorative practices** positioned as a key initiative for school climate improvement, though details on school-level application at Aloma High Charter remain absent from the available content.[1]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a collaborative program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. This initiative targets ""troubled students"" by using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events from agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on the district site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a submenu under Access and Opportunity, and detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—in middle and high schools.[1] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), listing it alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring and MTSS, but without elaboration.[1] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

This content indicates that **restorative approaches** are embedded in OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated by the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive cultures where collaboration and learning from failures support teachers and students.[1] **Restorative Justice** is conceptualized as a proactive diversionary counseling model for at-risk youth via law enforcement partnerships, while **restorative practices** emphasize relational, dialogue-based conflict resolution to teach interpersonal skills, build community, and proactively prevent issues—aligning with district-wide resilience traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance promoted through initiatives such as OCPS Mentoring.[1] However, the terms appear more as district-level strategies than deeply integrated school philosophies, with no evidence of customization for Aloma High Charter or comprehensive policy codification.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; **restorative practices** is simply listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without named personnel or implementation structures, and the Stellar Award context highlights behavior specialists like Lauren Fiallo but does not tie them directly to these practices.[1] Contact for related mentoring is provided (Christopher Ludwig), but restorative-specific support is not.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Timber Lakes Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are explicitly part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as structured district initiatives focused on addressing student behavior through counseling, relationship-building, and conflict resolution rather than solely punitive measures.[2][1 from scraped content: civil-citation] These terms are mentioned on four district website pages but absent from the Timber Lakes Elementary school website, indicating a district-level emphasis applicable to schools like Timber Lakes.[Source note: Terms found ONLY on the district website (4 pages), not on the school website.]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content: civil-citation] **Restorative practices**, mentioned more frequently, occur on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity resources, the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4).[2][Scraped content: site_map, accessopportunity, 55601_4] On the Access and Opportunity page, it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—while building community and teaching interpersonal skills.[2] The site map lists it alongside initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention, positioning it within school climate and culture efforts, while the Stellar page notes it peripherally in recognizing staff like behavior specialists.[Scraped content]

These concepts form a core element of OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the **Access and Opportunity Department**, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments through positive cultures where collaboration and learning from failures are valued.[Scraped content: accessopportunity] Restorative justice is conceptualized as proactive counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, shifting from punishment to root-cause intervention, while restorative practices emphasize dialogue-driven reconciliation to lower suspensions and promote resilience traits like empathy and responsible decision-making, aligning with broader goals of resilience and mentorship.[2][1 from scraped content][Scraped content: accessopportunity] This integration suggests a district-wide philosophical commitment to restorative approaches over exclusionary discipline, reflected in departmental priorities rather than isolated mentions.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; restorative practices are listed under Access and Opportunity without assigned roles, and restorative justice ties to external Civil Citation processes via police dashboards.[2][Scraped content] Mentoring is highlighted with a contact (Christopher Ludwig), but restorative efforts lack similar specifics, implying implementation through existing school support systems like behavior specialists (e.g., awardee Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary).[Scraped content: 55601_4][Scraped content: accessopportunity]

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for UCP East Charter / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within discipline and school culture programs, though not as a district-wide philosophical cornerstone or fully detailed policy framework.[1][2] The term **restorative justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a passing reference amid behavior specialist profiles; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools.[2]

These mentions position restorative approaches as practical tools within OCPS's broader emphasis on safe, inclusive environments and achievement gap reduction, rather than a core educational philosophy or mission statement element; they occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews, not official policies, staff listings, or strategic plans, suggesting peripheral rather than deeply integrated use.[1][2] On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices align with initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which builds resilience through traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance, reflecting a conceptualization focused on collaborative problem-solving and positive change over punitive measures.[2] The Civil Citation context frames restorative justice as a diversionary counseling intervention for at-risk students, linking it to law enforcement collaboration for non-exclusionary responses.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational departments solely for these practices; restorative practices is listed alongside efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention under Access and Opportunity, but without details on implementation structures.[1][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Whispering Oak Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the individual school level.[2][4]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Whispering Oak Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into a broader civil citation process tracked via a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events.[2] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (without direct elaboration), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where they are framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions and departmental initiatives rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual mentions; for instance, Restorative Practices is listed alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) under the Access and Opportunity department, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments.[4] The Civil Citation context ties Restorative Justice directly to diversionary interventions for disciplinary issues involving law enforcement.[2]

**Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** appear embedded in the district's philosophy as proactive tools for fostering resilience, collaboration, and reduced exclusionary discipline, aligning with quotes emphasizing productive school cultures where failures are learning experiences and faculty strive for improvement.[4] OCPS conceptualizes **Restorative Practices** as relationship-centered, dialogue-driven strategies that empower positive change and teach interpersonal skills to prevent future conflicts, while **Restorative Justice** targets counseling for underlying student issues in a law enforcement partnership—suggesting an integrated educational approach rather than peripheral references, though primarily highlighted for disciplinary support rather than core curriculum.[2][4]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation/Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are simply listed as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), with no further details on implementation, staffing, or school-specific rollout.[4] Similarly, the Civil Citation dashboard implies tracking but lacks structural specifics.[2]

This usage indicates Restorative Justice and Practices form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement under the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience, and collaboration.[3] Restorative Practices is conceptualized as proactive relationship-building and reactive conflict resolution to promote healthy interactions and teach interpersonal skills, aligning with broader goals like reducing suspensions and empowering change, while Restorative Justice focuses on counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships.[3] However, the mentions are not deeply integrated into core educational philosophy; they appear as specific initiatives rather than foundational principles, with no evidence of conceptualization extending to classroom-wide or philosophical overhauls.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; Restorative Practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity alongside mentoring and MTSS, but without operational specifics like staffing or training protocols.[3] The district's site map and department pages imply administrative support through this department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), but concrete implementation details are absent, limiting assessment of scale or enforcement.

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Wetherbee Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-wide programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no specific mentions tie directly to Wetherbee Elementary itself.[1] The term **restorative justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) mentioning behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary, though without detailing her restorative work; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—in middle and high schools.[1]

These references indicate that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy on school climate and discipline, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and lowering exclusionary practices rather than punitive measures, aligning with district commitments to safe, inclusive environments and resilience-building under Access and Opportunity.[1] However, they are not presented as core to a district-wide mission statement or universal policy but as specific program elements—official descriptions in departmental overviews and partnerships—rather than peripheral or casual mentions, suggesting intentional integration into educational support strategies without evidence of school-level adoption at Wetherbee Elementary.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, or centers; restorative practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, but without specified staff roles, budgets, or implementation guides beyond general goals.[1] Similarly, the restorative justice Civil Citation program lacks outlined structures like dedicated teams or sites, operating via law enforcement collaborations.[1] Based on the available content, deeper details on rollout, training, or metrics are absent, limiting assessment of full-scale integration.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Lake Nona Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though no direct mentions or implementations are evident on the Lake Nona Middle School website itself.[2]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, not the school site. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, on a Stellar Award Finalists page amid recognitions of staff contributions (without direct linkage), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2]

This usage positions restorative approaches as integral to OCPS's philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through proactive relationship-building and alternatives to traditional discipline, rather than peripheral or casual references. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in collaboration with law enforcement, while restorative practices emphasize community dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, and skill-building to prevent conflicts and lower exclusionary measures, aligning with broader goals like positive school cultures cited from Solution Tree principles.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units explicitly tied to these practices; mentions remain descriptive without implementation specifics like budgets, timelines, or school-level rollout.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Positive Pathways Transition Center / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the OCPS district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives to address student behavior, foster positive school cultures, and support at-risk students, including those at the Positive Pathways Transition Center.[1][2][6]

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned specifically on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students involved in school-based incidents and employs counseling to address root causes, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking ""School Based"" cases by agencies like OCPS District Police.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a framework to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools; and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), noting it alongside other supports like Mentoring and MTSS without further detail.[2][6] These are program descriptions and departmental listings, not formal policies or mission statements, with no mentions on the Positive Pathways Transition Center school website itself—terms were found only on district pages.[1]

This presence suggests restorative approaches align with OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on positive school cultures where collaboration and learning from failures prevail.[2] At Positive Pathways, an alternative school for students with Level 4 offenses, the district-linked school information page explicitly highlights **restorative approaches** within program features like small class sizes, trauma-informed practices, credit recovery, reflection, and reintegration planning, partnering with law enforcement and community agencies to build resilience and enable returns to home schools.[1] The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a diversionary counseling tool for disciplinary issues, while restorative practices emphasize relational, dialogue-driven strategies to cut suspensions and empower change—indicating philosophical integration into behavior management and transition support rather than peripheral references.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; mentions occur within broader Access and Opportunity initiatives like Mentoring, PASS, and School Support System, implying embedding in existing departmental structures without standalone elements.[2][6]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Orlando Science Middle High Charter, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the specific implementation at the charter school itself is not detailed in the available content.[4][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Orlando Science Middle High Charter school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures.[1-4 from scraped pages][4] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff profiles, serving as targeted mentions within broader school climate and support contexts.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering positive, inclusive environments and reducing punitive discipline, indicating philosophical integration rather than peripheral references. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes proactive counseling for at-risk students to prevent escalation through civil citations, positioning it as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice pathways.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices**, detailed more extensively, prioritize relationship-building, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically targeting reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; this extends to proactive community-building and skill-building to prevent future issues.[4] This aligns with the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps via safe, healthy learning environments, linking restorative methods to resilience traits like empathy and responsible decision-making in related mentoring initiatives.[1-4 from scraped pages]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly outlined, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, centers, or organizational units solely for these practices; mentions occur within the broader Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), which oversees restorative practices alongside mentoring, MTSS, and climate initiatives, but without specified staff titles or structured programs beyond general frameworks.[1-4 from scraped pages] The Civil Citation integration implies collaboration with law enforcement but lacks details on internal school-level rollout for Orlando Science Middle High Charter.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Esteem Academy school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appears three times: on the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), as a finalist highlight potentially linked to school support (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2 from search][1 from scraped pages]

This usage positions the terms within official program descriptions rather than broad mission statements or staff listings; **Restorative Justice** ties directly to an external partnership for diversionary counseling in lieu of traditional juvenile justice processes, while **restorative practices** aligns with the district's Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps through positive cultures.[2][1 from scraped pages] They are not passing mentions but named initiatives alongside related efforts like mentoring and climate support.

**Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** form part of the district's philosophy for fostering productive school cultures, as evidenced by their placement in Access and Opportunity's commitment to collaboration, resilience-building (e.g., traits like empathy and responsible decision-making), and proactive conflict resolution over punitive measures. The district conceptualizes **restorative practices** as relationship-centered tools for dialogue and growth, explicitly aimed at suspension reduction and community-building, echoing broader restorative principles of accountability without exclusion.[2] **Restorative Justice** is more narrowly defined as root-cause counseling for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, suggesting a hybrid approach blending counseling with justice diversion. While integrated into educational support structures like Access and Opportunity—which promotes ""positive, productive school cultures"" through faculty support and learning from failures—these elements appear as targeted strategies rather than a district-wide overhaul of discipline.[1 from scraped pages][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content. There are no mentions of specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices. **Restorative practices** falls under the broader Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), which lists it alongside mentoring and newsletters, but lacks implementation details like training protocols or case metrics. Similarly, **Restorative Justice** references a Sheriff's Office/Police partnership without specifying school-level rollout or resources. The scraped content provides insufficient detail to assess depth of integration at Esteem Academy specifically or district-wide execution, limiting insights into practical application.[1 from scraped pages][2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Oakland Avenue Charter / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though specific implementation at Oakland Avenue Charter School is not detailed on the school website.[3][2 from scraped content]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the Oakland Avenue Charter School site. ""Restorative Justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department and OCPS District Police.[2 from scraped content] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS; on the Access and Opportunity home page as a framework to foster positive school cultures, reduce suspensions (especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations), build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and teach interpersonal skills; and peripherally on a Stellar Award Finalists page without direct context.[1][3][4 from scraped content] These are program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive, relationship-centered strategies to create supportive environments and minimize punitive discipline, aligning with a broader philosophy of positive school cultures where collaboration, resilience, and personal responsibility drive student success, as reflected in Access and Opportunity's emphasis on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive settings.[3 from scraped content] Restorative practices are positioned as a core initiative to empower change through dialogue, distinct from but complementary to restorative justice's counseling focus for at-risk students.[2][3 from scraped content] This suggests philosophical integration into the district's educational approach, particularly for climate and behavior management, rather than peripheral mentions.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked restorative justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation, staffing, or resources.[1][3][4 from scraped content]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) District Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are integrated components of Orange County Public Schools' district-wide approach to school discipline and school climate. These terms appear explicitly across multiple district web pages, indicating they are part of the district's official framework rather than isolated initiatives.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a formal partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] This framing positions restorative justice as a collaborative law enforcement and school-based intervention targeting at-risk youth. The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a distinct initiative under the Access and Opportunity department, suggesting it is an organized, departmentalized program. The Stellar Award Finalists page references restorative practices in the context of recognizing educators who implement these approaches, though the specific content is not fully detailed in the available materials. Most comprehensively, the Access and Opportunity Home page provides substantive description of restorative practices as a key initiative.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative practices represent a deliberate philosophical commitment within OCPS to reshape school discipline and culture. According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, ""Restorative Practices are a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment.""[3] The district conceptualizes these practices as fundamentally relational and participatory: ""This approach prioritizes the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] A core principle is inclusive dialogue—""A core tenet of Restorative Practices is ensuring that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts. By facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, these practices enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] The district specifically targets three key disciplinary infractions through this approach: ""Restorative Practices aim to significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.""[3] This philosophy reflects a shift from punitive discipline toward reconciliation and community-building, with the district viewing restorative practices as both a conflict resolution mechanism and a proactive tool for teaching interpersonal skills.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established organizational infrastructure to support restorative practices implementation. The Access and Opportunity department serves as the administrative home for these initiatives, indicating departmental-level commitment. The district employs specialized staff positions, including Restorative Justice and Wellness Specialists, who ""develop, plan and facilitate restorative justice and school wellness programs, activities, and services for at-risk youth"" and ""conduct and facilitate restorative circles and provide safety and security at school site.""[4] The district also operates the ACCESS Program, a ""public, WASC accredited educational program offering a variety of unique school options serving students throughout Orange County,"" which incorporates restorative justice and wellness components as part of its alternative education pathway for at-risk students.[4] Additionally, OCPS has formalized partnerships with external agencies—specifically the Sheriff's Office and Police Department—to implement the Civil Citation Restorative Justice program, which diverts students from traditional criminal justice processing by using counseling and restorative approaches to address underlying issues.[1] The district's mentoring initiative, overseen by the Access and Opportunity department, complements restorative practices by building resilience and supportive relationships across the student population.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though the specific implementation at Innovations Middle Charter School remains unclear from available content, as terms appear exclusively on district pages.

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), listing it alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring;[1] a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) with no substantive context beyond the term's presence;[1] and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with the Access and Opportunity page providing the deepest programmatic detail.

This indicates **restorative practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as a proactive strategy for school climate and discipline**, conceptualized as relationship-focused, inclusive problem-solving that emphasizes dialogue, community-building circles, and skill-building to prevent conflicts and lower exclusionary discipline—aligning with the district's commitment to safe, healthy environments and narrowing achievement gaps via the Access and Opportunity department.[2] Restorative justice, however, appears more peripherally as a targeted intervention for civil citations involving law enforcement collaboration, suggesting a narrower, reactive application tied to juvenile justice diversion rather than a core philosophical pillar.[1] The district links these to broader goals like resilience-building through mentoring and positive cultures, quoting Solution Tree on collaborative, learning-oriented environments.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named programs or centers beyond the Civil Citation/Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these terms; trained school staff (administrators, teachers, counselors) are noted generically as facilitators for restorative practices in related district documents, but not within the scraped pages.[5] The Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470) oversees restorative practices alongside mentoring and other supports, implying departmental coordination without evident school-level specialization.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Sunridge Elementary**

Restorative Justice and **restorative practices** form part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school climate, though specific implementation at Sunridge Elementary is not detailed in the available content[2][1]. These terms appear explicitly on four district website pages, indicating an intentional integration into broader support systems rather than isolated or peripheral mentions.

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal district program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. This positions restorative justice as an alternative to traditional disciplinary measures for certain offenses[1]. **Restorative practices**, appearing on three pages, are more prominently featured. The site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) lists it under the Access and Opportunity department's Climate & Culture submenu, alongside initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention[1]. The Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity) provides the most detailed description: a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations. It emphasizes proactive skill-building in interpersonal relations and community[2]. A passing reference occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), in a profile of behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary, though without linking her work directly to restorative practices[1].

These references suggest **restorative justice** and practices are embedded in OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments conducive to learning. The district conceptualizes them as relationship-centered alternatives to punitive discipline, aligning with goals of resilience, empathy, and collaborative problem-solving—echoed in related initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which builds traits such as self-awareness, grit, and responsible decision-making[2]. However, they appear more as programmatic tools for behavior intervention and suspension reduction than a fully articulated district-wide philosophy or core mission statement element.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or school-level structures. Restorative practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), but without mentions of facilitators, professional development, or Sunridge-specific rollout[2]. The Civil Citation program's law enforcement partnerships imply operational support, but details on training or dedicated roles are absent[1]. This limits insights into practical implementation, particularly at the elementary level like Sunridge.

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives within district operations.** The district explicitly references **Restorative Justice** on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, designed to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** are mentioned on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, and detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures by building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page in the context of a behavior specialist's work, though without elaboration.[1]

These terms are embedded in official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than broad mission statements or policies, indicating a practical rather than philosophical cornerstone. **Restorative Justice** is conceptualized as a diversionary intervention for at-risk students involving law enforcement collaboration and counseling, while **restorative practices** emphasize proactive community-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts and lower disciplinary actions, aligning with the Access and Opportunity department's goal of narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments.[3] This suggests integration into the district's educational approach as supportive tools for behavior management and equity, though not as a district-wide philosophy overriding traditional discipline.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices and related initiatives like mentoring.[3] The Civil Citation program's Restorative Justice lacks mentions of implementation details like training or staffing.[1] Overall, the available content provides programmatic descriptions but limited depth on execution, making it challenging to assess full-scale adoption or outcomes.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing East River High School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.**[4]

Restorative Justice appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content] Restorative Practices is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools—specifically targeting infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations while teaching interpersonal skills.[4]

These terms reflect a philosophical commitment within OCPS to shift from punitive measures toward supportive, relationship-focused strategies that promote resilience, collaboration, and proactive conflict prevention, aligning with broader district goals of safe, inclusive environments under the Access and Opportunity department, which emphasizes positive school cultures as key to teacher and student success.[4] Restorative Practices is positioned as integral to this philosophy, not merely peripheral, as it supports key initiatives like reducing suspensions and building community, while Restorative Justice serves as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships.[1 from scraped content]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; mentions remain descriptive without evidence of implementation scale, dedicated centers, or personnel like those highlighted in staff awards.[1 from scraped content][4] The Access and Opportunity department oversees related efforts like mentoring, which complements restorative aims by fostering traits such as empathy, responsibility, and resilience, but lacks direct ties to restorative training or circles.[4]

These terms appear across four specific pages on the district's website, with **restorative justice** mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a named program developed in partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department; it targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to identify and resolve root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under the Access and Opportunity department's offerings alongside initiatives like Mentoring and MTSS; briefly on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" for fostering positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and specifically aiming to decrease suspensions for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][2 from scraped content] These mentions frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual references, indicating deliberate inclusion in district operations.[3]

The content suggests **Restorative Justice** forms part of OCPS's core philosophy for student support and discipline, conceptualized as a restorative alternative to traditional juvenile justice processes—emphasizing counseling over citations for identified at-risk students—and closely aligned with **restorative practices**, which the district views as a relationship-centered approach to prevent conflicts, teach interpersonal skills, and create inclusive environments that narrow achievement gaps.[3][1 from scraped content] This integration appears embedded in the broader educational strategy, as evidenced by its placement within the Access and Opportunity department's mission to maintain ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments"" through initiatives like mentoring (which lists traits such as empathy, responsibility, and resilience) and PASS, reflecting a shift toward collaborative, non-exclusionary methods.[2 from scraped content]

""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a listed initiative under Access and Opportunity, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without contextual detail amid staff recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools.[1]

These references suggest restorative justice and practices form part of OCPS's disciplinary philosophy, shifting from punitive measures toward root-cause counseling and relationship-building, as evidenced by the Civil Citation program's focus on troubled students and the Access and Opportunity emphasis on inclusive environments to narrow achievement gaps. However, the mentions are peripheral—listed in site navigation, award contexts, and initiative overviews—rather than embedded in core mission statements or detailed policies, indicating they are not centrally conceptualized or deeply integrated into a district-wide educational philosophy based on the scraped content.

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate approach. These terms appear across multiple district-level web pages and are integrated into official policy frameworks and program descriptions rather than presented as peripheral mentions.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear in four distinct contexts across the OCPS website. First, on the Civil Citation page, the district describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in a program called ""Restorative Justice,"" which the district characterizes as identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues.[1] Second, Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative within the Access and Opportunity department, which is responsible for maintaining safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[1] Third, the site map identifies Restorative Practices as a standalone departmental focus area under the Access and Opportunity section, indicating organizational prominence.[1] Fourth, Restorative Practices are mentioned in the context of recognizing exemplary educators, suggesting the approach is embedded in school culture and practice.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school discipline and culture. The district defines Restorative Practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes relationship-building among all school community members with the explicit goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.[1] The philosophy emphasizes ensuring that ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving, which the district states ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[1] Specifically, OCPS targets infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations through these practices, aiming to build school culture focused on relationships while simultaneously teaching social-emotional and conflict-resolution skills.[1] This represents an integrated philosophical approach rather than a supplementary program.

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that Restorative Practices are administered through the Access and Opportunity department, which operates from 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[1] However, the provided content does not specify dedicated staff positions such as restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists, nor does it identify specific restorative justice centers or alternative programs by name.

"**Restorative Justice is not part of UCP Transitional Learning Academy Charter / Orange's approach, as no mentions of restorative justice, restorative practices, or related terms appear on the school's website; all references are found exclusively on the Orange County Public Schools district website.**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear solely on four district pages, not on any UCP Transitional Learning Academy-specific sites. On https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation, **restorative justice** is described in the context of a Civil Citation program, where the district partners with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, linking to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice dashboard for school-based events[1]. ""Restorative practices"" is listed under the Access and Opportunity department's site map at https://www.ocps.net/site_map, alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring[2]. The same term appears on https://www.ocps.net/55601_4 in a Stellar Award finalist profile for behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary, though without direct elaboration amid descriptions of her interventions for students with autism[3]. Most substantively, https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity defines **restorative practices** as a framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools[4]. These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff assignments specific to UCP Transitional Learning Academy.

Content does not indicate that restorative justice forms part of the school's or district's core philosophy for UCP Transitional Learning Academy, a charter focused on students with disabilities and IEPs via inclusive, holistic education, therapy, job training, and diploma tracks like the Standard Diploma with Florida Access Points[5][6]. District references treat these terms peripherally as supportive tools for behavior intervention and culture-building within broader Access and Opportunity efforts, not as integrated elements of the charter school's specialized approach to transitional learning for middle/high school and post-graduate students.

No infrastructure is evident for restorative justice at UCP Transitional Learning Academy. District pages mention no dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., centers or academies), training initiatives, or organizational structures tied to these terms for the charter school; restorative practices is simply one initiative among others like Mentoring and MTSS in the Access and Opportunity department[4][2].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Cornerstone Academy Charter / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Cornerstone Academy Charter itself.[1][3]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the ""Civil Citation"" page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies ""troubled students"" and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under ""Access and Opportunity"" departments; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff listing without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[3]

These references suggest restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy on school climate and equity, integrated into the **Access and Opportunity** department's mission to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures, as quoted from Solution Tree on collaborative, learning-oriented schools. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a counseling-based diversion for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize proactive relationship-building and dialogue over punishment, aligning with district goals like resilience-building (e.g., traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance in the OCPS Mentoring initiative).[3] However, the mentions are program-descriptive rather than embedded in core mission statements or policies, indicating a peripheral rather than centrally philosophical role.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's inclusion of restorative practices among initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention. The Civil Citation program's dashboard implies some tracking mechanism, but no facilitators, trainings, or school-specific implementations are named.[1][3]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at Cornerstone Charter Academy High / Orange is not detailed in the available content.**[2][6]

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the school's own site. ""Restorative justice"" is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated into a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" is listed in the site map under Access and Opportunity departments, highlighted as a key initiative on the Access and Opportunity home page to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations, particularly in middle and high schools.[2] It also appears peripherally on a Stellar Award Finalists page amid recognitions of staff contributions to school climate.[3] These references frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than policies, staff listings, or mission statements, with restorative practices explicitly tied to proactive community-building and conflict-resolution skills.[2][6]

This indicates restorative justice and practices form a core element of OCPS's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as relationship-focused alternatives to traditional punishment, emphasizing dialogue, empathy, and growth to create inclusive environments and lower exclusionary discipline.[2][6] They are integrated into the district's educational approach via the Access and Opportunity department, which supports safe learning through initiatives like climate and culture management, rather than treated as peripheral mentions.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, or training programs; however, restorative practices are facilitated by trained school staff including administrators, teachers, or counselors using methods like affective statements, restorative questions, community-building circles, and conflict resolution circles, with successful completion serving as an alternative consequence.[6] The Access and Opportunity department at 445 W. Amelia Street provides organizational support, linking to broader efforts like mentoring for resilience traits (e.g., self-awareness, grit, empathy).[2]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Innovation Montessori Ocoee, incorporates both Restorative Justice and restorative practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the individual school level is not detailed in the available content.[2][6]**  

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), which cuts off without further context; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2] These references occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with the Civil Citation page providing the clearest programmatic example and Access and Opportunity emphasizing proactive community-building.[2][6]  

This usage indicates that restorative approaches form part of the district's broader philosophy on school climate and discipline, conceptualized as relationship-focused alternatives to traditional punishment that promote accountability, empathy, and growth through methods like dialogue, circles, and counseling, rather than peripheral or one-off mentions.[2][6] They align with OCPS's Access and Opportunity department's commitment to safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as seen in related initiatives like mentoring that build resilience traits such as self-awareness, grit, and responsible decision-making.[2]  

No dedicated infrastructure—such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units—is explicitly detailed in the content; restorative practices fall under the general Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), with trained school staff (administrators, teachers, counselors) facilitating circles for qualifying incidents, but without named roles or programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership.[2][6]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, though specific implementation at Renaissance Charter School at Chickasaw Trail is not detailed in the available content.[1][5] The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and peripherally in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), framing it as a framework within the district's efforts to foster positive school cultures.[1]

These references position restorative approaches as official program descriptions rather than passing mentions or staff listings, with restorative practices conceptualized as a comprehensive strategy to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—through methods such as dialogue, collaborative problem-solving, affective statements, restorative questions, community-building circles, and conflict resolution circles.[1][5] This indicates integration into the district's educational philosophy, specifically under the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments; it aligns with broader goals like resilience-building via mentoring and aligns restorative practices as an alternative consequence to traditional discipline.[1][5]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, or training programs; restorative practices are instead facilitated by trained general school staff like administrators, teachers, or counselors, suggesting a decentralized model embedded in existing structures like the School Support System and Mentoring initiatives.[1][5] While restorative justice ties into civil citation processes with law enforcement, and restorative practices support climate and culture efforts, the content lacks details on school-level rollout, training, or metrics, limiting assessment of depth at Renaissance Charter School at Chickasaw Trail.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Sunshine High School-Greater Orlando Campus**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district's approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within disciplinary alternatives and school culture efforts, though not as a district-wide philosophy or core policy[2][1]. The term **restorative justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, and is detailed on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[2]. A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff directory context, without elaboration[3]. These mentions position the terms within program descriptions and departmental listings rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff roles.

The content suggests restorative practices align peripherally with OCPS's philosophy of creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as articulated in the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to positive school cultures where collaboration supports teachers and students[2]. Restorative justice is conceptualized more narrowly as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize proactive relationship-building and suspension reduction, connecting to broader goals like resilience and mentorship[2][1]. However, these elements are not deeply integrated into the district's core educational approach, appearing as specific tools rather than foundational principles, with no evidence of mandatory adoption across all schools.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures like centers; restorative practices is listed under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside mentoring and climate efforts, but without implementation details, timelines, or resources[2]. Similarly, the restorative justice program lacks mentions of facilitators, training, or school-specific rollout, limiting insights into practical support.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district overseeing PINECREST PREPARATORY CHARTER / ORANGE, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and school climate approach, though the specific implementation at the individual charter school level remains unclear from available content.[1][5]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the PINECREST PREPARATORY CHARTER school website itself. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures.[5] These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than formal policies or mission statements, serving as passing yet purposeful mentions within broader school support contexts.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to fostering positive, inclusive environments and reducing punitive discipline, indicating philosophical integration rather than peripheral use. **Restorative Justice** emphasizes counseling to resolve underlying issues for at-risk students, diverting from traditional juvenile justice pathways.[1] **Restorative practices**, positioned under the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps and maintain safe learning spaces, prioritize relationship-building, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and specifically targeting reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[5] This aligns with a proactive philosophy of community-building and skill development in empathy and problem-solving, quoted alongside Solution Tree insights on productive school cultures.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed alongside broader efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention under Access and Opportunity, but without elaboration on implementation structures.[5] The Civil Citation dashboard implies tracking mechanisms for school-based restorative events, but operational details are absent.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), ACCESS CHARTER / ORANGE**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives aimed at addressing student behavior through counseling, relationship-building, and conflict resolution rather than solely punitive measures.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address the root causes of their problems, integrated into the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a passing reference amid staff profiles without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). There, it is framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, prioritize relationships among community members, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates, particularly in middle and high schools.[3]

These concepts appear embedded in official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than as standalone policies, mission statements, or staff listings. For instance, restorative justice is presented as a collaborative law enforcement-school intervention for civil citations, while restorative practices aligns with broader Access and Opportunity efforts to create safe, inclusive environments and narrow achievement gaps through positive cultures.[3]

Restorative justice and practices form a meaningful, though not centrally philosophical, element of OCPS's educational approach, conceptualized as proactive tools for behavior intervention, resilience-building, and cultural improvement rather than core tenets of the district's identity. They emphasize root-cause counseling, dialogue-driven accountability, and relationship maintenance to promote positive change, as seen in the restorative justice program's focus on troubled students and restorative practices' goal of empowering conflict resolution.[1][2][3] This integration supports initiatives like mentoring under Access and Opportunity, which cultivates traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance alongside restorative methods.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; mentions are limited to general facilitation by trained school staff (administrators, teachers, counselors) implied in related contexts, with restorative practices housed under the Access and Opportunity department at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando.[3] External search results suggest broader regional use of restorative practices in Orange County schools, including OCPS implementations for offenses like disrespect or altercations via circles and affective statements, potentially serving as alternatives to traditional discipline.[5] However, the scraped pages provide no explicit OCPS infrastructure details.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for PINECREST CREEK CHARTER / ORANGE**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[1][4] These terms are mentioned on four specific district website pages: the Civil Citation page describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of problems, presented as an official program description linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] The term **restorative practices** appears on the site map under the Access and Opportunity department, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (as a passing mention in a behavior specialist's profile without elaboration), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page, where it is framed as a **comprehensive framework** to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[4]

These concepts appear integrated into OCPS's broader philosophy of creating safe, healthy, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, as evidenced by their placement within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which emphasizes positive school cultures, resilience, and collaboration for the common good.[4] Restorative Justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based intervention for at-risk students in partnership with law enforcement, shifting from punitive measures to root-cause resolution via civil citations.[1] Restorative practices are portrayed as a relationship-centered approach to conflict resolution and community-building, explicitly aimed at decreasing suspensions and teaching interpersonal skills, aligning with district goals like resilience traits (e.g., empathy, responsibility, perseverance) promoted in related mentoring initiatives.[4] While not central to mission statements, they reflect a philosophical commitment to restorative over exclusionary discipline, though mentions are descriptive rather than deeply embedded across all pages.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without details on implementation, staffing, or training.[4] The Civil Citation program's Restorative Justice lacks mentions of specialized roles or structures, appearing as a collaborative external partnership rather than an in-house system.[1] Based on the available content, infrastructure details are insufficient to assess depth of implementation.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Orlando Science Elementary Charter school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department and OCPS District Police.[2 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in the context of a behavior specialist's work, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a ""comprehensive framework"" for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][1 from scraped content][4 from scraped content]

This usage positions restorative approaches as integral to the district's philosophy on school climate and discipline, rather than peripheral mentions. OCPS conceptualizes **Restorative Justice** as a proactive intervention for at-risk youth via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing counseling over traditional punishment, while **restorative practices** align with broader goals of positive school cultures, resilience-building, and inclusive environments under the Access and Opportunity department, which quotes Solution Tree on productive cultures and lists them alongside initiatives like mentoring (focusing on traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance).[3][2 from scraped content] These terms reflect a philosophy prioritizing relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and reduced exclusionary discipline to foster learning and growth, connected to district-wide efforts in MTSS, climate & culture, and vape prevention.[1 from scraped content]

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, restorative centers, or training programs; restorative practices fall under the Access and Opportunity department (445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL), with contact at 407-317-3200 x 2003470, and a behavior specialist like Lauren Fiallo at Dillard St. Elementary exemplifies application through interventions for aggressive behaviors and transitions for students with autism.[4 from scraped content][3] The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program links to external dashboards and police partnerships but lacks mentions of internal staff roles or structured training.[2 from scraped content]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Sun Blaze Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student support, discipline alternatives, and positive school climates, though no direct mentions occur on the Sun Blaze Elementary school website itself.[2]

The term **restorative justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a formal partnership program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. This positions restorative justice as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice processing, emphasizing identification and intervention over punitive measures.[2] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described in detail; and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), listed alongside programs like Mentoring and MTSS without elaboration. These are program descriptions and departmental listings, not formal policies, mission statements, or staff profiles.[2]

This usage indicates that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department. Restorative practices are conceptualized as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills proactively.[2] Restorative justice complements this by diverting at-risk students from civil citations via counseling, aligning with district goals of resilience, mentorship, and positive cultures quoted from Solution Tree. However, these appear as specialized supports rather than a fully integrated, school-wide educational philosophy, with mentions peripheral to core operations like calendars or school choice.[2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's listing of restorative practices among initiatives like Mentoring, PASS, and Vape Prevention. The Civil Citation program's partnership implies collaborative implementation with law enforcement, but lacks mentions of training, budgets, or school-specific rollout.[2]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted programs within district initiatives focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.**

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events[1]. In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives[2]; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief staff context without elaboration[3]; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, reduce suspensions in middle and high schools (especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations), foster relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and teach interpersonal skills[4].

These references indicate **restorative justice and practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy**, particularly within the district's emphasis on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps via the Access and Opportunity department. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based diversion from traditional juvenile justice, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and personal responsibility to prevent conflicts—aligning with broader goals like positive school cultures quoted from Solution Tree[4]. However, mentions are program-descriptive rather than core mission statements, suggesting a practical rather than philosophical centerpiece.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices alongside initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention[2][4].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing OCVS Digital Academy / Orange, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as explicit components of its disciplinary and school climate strategies, though the available content provides limited depth on implementation specifics.[4][1 from query]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the school-specific site for OCVS Digital Academy. **Restorative justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from query] **Restorative practices** are referenced on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid behavior specialist recognitions, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures.[1 from query][4]

In terms of philosophy, **restorative practices** form a core part of OCPS's approach to school climate and culture, conceptualized as a proactive strategy to foster relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[4][1 from query] This aligns with the Access and Opportunity department's mission to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, alongside initiatives like mentoring that emphasize resilience traits such as empathy and responsible decision-making.[1 from query] **Restorative justice**, by contrast, appears more narrowly as a targeted intervention for disciplinary diversion via counseling, suggesting a philosophical shift toward addressing underlying problems rather than purely punitive measures, though it is presented as a collaborative law enforcement program rather than a standalone district-wide ethos.[1 from query]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational charts explicitly tied to these practices; mentions are confined to departmental listings (e.g., under Access and Opportunity's Climate & Culture and PASS initiatives) and program partnerships, with behavior specialists like Lauren Fiallo highlighted for related interventions but not formally linked.[1 from query] This leaves the extent of implementation—such as training scope or school-level rollout—unclear from the scraped pages.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as integral to creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, positioning **restorative practices** within the Access and Opportunity department's philosophy of positive, productive school cultures where collaboration and support drive improvement.[3] **Restorative justice** functions more as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, emphasizing counseling over punitive measures.[1] While not framed in core mission statements, they align with broader goals like climate and culture enhancement, suggesting philosophical integration into discipline rather than peripheral mentions.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training details, or organizational units solely for these practices; restorative practices fall under the general Access and Opportunity department at 445 W. Amelia Street, with contact via 407-317-3200 x 2003470, but implementation relies on school staff without specified roles.[1][3] Related efforts like OCPS Mentoring (focusing on resilience traits) and PASS coexist but are not explicitly tied.[1][3]

"# Analysis of Legends Academy Charter / Orange's Restorative Justice Approach

**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice and restorative practices are not part of Legends Academy Charter / Orange's documented approach. The terms appear only on the Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district website, not on the school's own website. The school itself does not maintain dedicated content, programs, or infrastructure related to these practices.

**Contextual Understanding**: The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four OCPS district-level pages: the Civil Citation page, the site map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity home page. These mentions occur within district-wide initiatives and departmental structures rather than school-specific programs. On the Civil Citation page, the district describes a partnership between the Orange County School District, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department in creating a ""Restorative Justice"" program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] On the Access and Opportunity page, ""Restorative Practices"" is listed as one of several key initiatives under the district's broader commitment to ""narrowing achievement gaps by fostering an environment conducive to learning.""[2] These references position restorative approaches as district-level policy and programming rather than school-specific implementation.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is part of Legends Academy Charter / Orange's educational philosophy. The school does not appear to have dedicated web content addressing these practices, and the district-level mentions do not specify which schools participate in restorative justice programs or how individual schools implement these approaches. The district's broader philosophy emphasizes ""positive, productive school cultures"" and safe, healthy, inclusive learning environments, but without school-specific documentation, the extent to which Legends Academy Charter / Orange has integrated restorative practices into its own approach remains unclear.

**Infrastructure**: No infrastructure specific to Legends Academy Charter / Orange related to restorative justice or restorative practices is evident from the available content. The district maintains an Access and Opportunity department that oversees restorative practices initiatives district-wide, but no dedicated staff positions, programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures are identified as belonging to or serving Legends Academy Charter / Orange specifically.

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Sunridge Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no specific mentions occur on the Sunridge Middle School website itself.[1][2]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the district's Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events involving agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. This positions restorative justice as an official, law-enforcement-linked intervention for disciplinary matters, distinct from punitive measures.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity > Climate & Culture; the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff recognition context. The most detailed description on the Access and Opportunity page defines restorative practices as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and specifically reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations. These are presented as program descriptions within the Access and Opportunity department, not as standalone policies, mission statements, or staff listings, though the site map suggests navigational integration under school support themes like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, MTSS, Mentoring, and Vape Prevention.[1][2]

This usage indicates that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for positive, inclusive school environments and resilience-building, particularly through the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to ""narrowing achievement gaps"" by maintaining ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments."" Restorative practices align with district emphases on collaboration, empathy, and proactive conflict skills, echoing resiliency traits like self-awareness, grit, responsible decision-making, and perseverance promoted in related initiatives like OCPS Mentoring. However, restorative justice seems more peripherally tied to external civil citation processes for serious behavioral issues, while restorative practices represent a more embedded educational strategy for daily school culture, conceptualized as relationship-focused alternatives to exclusionary discipline rather than comprehensive philosophical overhauls.[1][2]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices is listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring and School Support System without further implementation details. A behavior specialist like Lauren Fiallo (recognized on the Stellar Award page) demonstrates related expertise in interventions for aggressive behaviors and transitions, but this is not explicitly linked to restorative practices.[1]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district overseeing Orange County Preparatory Academy Charter, incorporates both Restorative Justice and restorative practices as elements of its disciplinary and school climate strategies, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the charter school level.[3][1]**  

Restorative Justice appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling to uncover root causes, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[3] Restorative practices are mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] These references occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with passing mentions alongside broader initiatives like mentoring and climate support.[3]  

This usage suggests restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, conceptualized as proactive tools for relationship-building, collaborative problem-solving, and alternatives to exclusionary discipline, aligning with district goals for resilience and positive cultures quoted from Solution Tree.[3] However, the mentions are peripheral rather than centrally integrated, lacking evidence of embedding across all schools or tying directly to core educational approaches.[1][3]  

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond general Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices are listed alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring and PASS without elaboration on implementation mechanisms.[3]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a district partnership with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and address issues through counseling to reach the root cause of problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[scraped content: civil-citation] **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief staff context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2][scraped content: accessopportunity][scraped content: site_map][scraped content: 55601_4] These references position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than broad mission statements, policies, or staff listings, with the Civil Citation serving as a practical diversion program and Access and Opportunity emphasizing proactive culture-building.

This suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, integrated into educational support structures like Access and Opportunity alongside mentoring and resilience-building**, which aligns traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance with restorative goals.[2][scraped content: accessopportunity] The district conceptualizes Restorative Justice as a counseling-based intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while Restorative Practices emphasize relational, dialogue-driven conflict resolution to proactively teach skills and cut suspensions, reflecting a shift toward accountability over exclusionary discipline. However, the mentions are not deeply embedded across the site, appearing more as targeted initiatives than a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for restorative approaches; Restorative Practices falls under the broader Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), and a behavior specialist like Lauren Fiallo is highlighted for interventions but not explicitly tied to restorative roles.[scraped content: accessopportunity][scraped content: 55601_4] The content lacks sufficient detail to assess full implementation at Lake Nona High School specifically.

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Millennia Gardens Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives, on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[2] A related district document outlines restorative practices as involving trained staff facilitating conflict resolution circles, affective statements, restorative questions, and community-building to promote inclusiveness and serve as alternatives to traditional consequences.[6] These are presented as official program descriptions within departments like Access and Opportunity, rather than peripheral mentions or staff listings.

The district conceptualizes these approaches as central to its philosophy of creating safe, inclusive learning environments and narrowing achievement gaps, with restorative practices explicitly tied to positive school cultures, resilience-building alongside mentoring, and proactive conflict reduction in middle and high schools.[2] Restorative Justice functions more as a targeted intervention for civil citations involving law enforcement collaboration, while restorative practices represent a broader, relationship-focused strategy integrated into discipline to teach social-emotional skills and replace punitive measures.[2][6] This suggests a philosophical commitment to restorative principles over exclusionary discipline, aligning with district goals like those in Access and Opportunity for collaboration and growth.

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly detailed, such as named coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs; however, restorative practices are facilitated by trained school staff including administrators, teachers, or counselors, and occur within the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring.[2][6] The Civil Citation program's dashboard implies administrative tracking for school-based restorative justice events.[2] Without further details, implementation appears decentralized across schools rather than through specialized units.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Independence Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs rather than a comprehensive, school-wide philosophy at Independence Elementary.[3][1 from scraped content] Specifically, **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[2 from scraped content] In contrast, **restorative practices** are highlighted more prominently on the Access and Opportunity department page as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4 from scraped content][3] These terms also appear peripherally on the site map under Access and Opportunity initiatives and in a Stellar Award finalist profile, though without detailed context there.[1 from scraped content][3 from scraped content]

The mentions occur exclusively on district-level pages—Civil Citation, Access and Opportunity Home, site map, and a staff recognition page—framed as official program descriptions and departmental initiatives, not as policies, mission statements, or school-specific implementations.[1-4 from scraped content] For instance, restorative practices are positioned alongside efforts like mentoring, MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), and vape prevention under the Access and Opportunity department, which focuses on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps.[4 from scraped content] This suggests a district-wide emphasis on proactive, relationship-based alternatives to traditional discipline, though no evidence ties it directly to Independence Elementary's operations, as terms were absent from the school website.

While these concepts align with a broader philosophy of positive school climates—echoed in Access and Opportunity's quote on productive cultures and resilience traits like empathy and responsibility—**Restorative Justice appears more peripherally as a diversion program for at-risk students**, whereas restorative practices indicate deeper integration into climate and culture strategies.[4 from scraped content][2 from scraped content] The district conceptualizes restorative practices as a tool for collaborative problem-solving and suspension reduction, emphasizing community-building over punishment, but the content lacks evidence of it as a core educational pillar or universal approach across all schools.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices as a key initiative.[4 from scraped content] Mentoring is mentioned separately with resilience traits, but not explicitly linked to restorative methods, and no programs like restorative circles or conferences are named for OCPS itself.[4 from scraped content]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Innovation Middle School**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs aimed at addressing student behavior and fostering positive school environments, though no specific implementation details tie directly to Innovation Middle School.[1][3]

The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department. It targets ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department and OCPS District Police. This positions it as an official diversionary measure within the disciplinary system, distinct from punitive actions.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid broader department listings without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity). Here, it is described as a ""comprehensive framework"" to build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools—while teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future issues.[3]

These references indicate restorative approaches form part of OCPS's core philosophy for school climate and culture, integrated into the district's educational strategy rather than treated peripherally. The Access and Opportunity department conceptualizes restorative practices as essential for ""positive, productive school cultures"" that support teachers and students through collaboration, viewing failures as learning opportunities and prioritizing resilience-building alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring (emphasizing traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance).[3] Restorative justice aligns with this by shifting from punishment to root-cause counseling, reflecting a broader commitment to inclusive, healthy environments that narrow achievement gaps.[1][3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational units explicitly for restorative justice. Restorative practices falls under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), alongside efforts like Mentoring and MTSS, but lacks mentions of implementation structures, timelines, or school-specific rollout.[3] The Stellar Award page highlights behavior specialists like Lauren Fiallo, who develops interventions for aggressive behaviors in autistic students, but does not link this to restorative methods.[1]

This usage positions restorative approaches as components of official district programs and departmental initiatives rather than peripheral mentions or staff listings. **Restorative Justice functions as an alternative disciplinary tool linked to law enforcement collaboration, while restorative practices embody a proactive philosophy for inclusive, relationship-centered school environments, aligning with broader goals of safe, healthy learning cultures under Access and Opportunity.** The district conceptualizes these as strategies to enhance resilience, community, and conflict resolution, echoing quotes on productive school cultures where collaboration and learning from failures are prioritized[3].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation integration, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed as a key initiative under the Access and Opportunity department (445 W.

Similarly, related efforts like OCPS Mentoring emphasize resilience-building but do not explicitly tie to restorative methods. **The content provides programmatic descriptions but lacks depth on philosophy integration, training, or school-level application, making it insufficient to assess full implementation at Bay Lake Elementary.**

"# Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices at Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are **established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school culture framework**, though the available content does not provide school-specific information for Renaissance Charter School at Goldenrod. The district has formally integrated these approaches into its official policies and programs at the district level.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms appear across multiple OCPS district web pages in official policy and program contexts. On the Civil Citation page, OCPS describes a partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to create a ""Restorative Justice"" program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Access and Opportunity department, a district-level initiative, features a dedicated section on ""Restorative Practices"" describing them as a ""comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" with the goal of ""reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[1] These terms also appear in the district's site map under the Access and Opportunity department's key initiatives, indicating they are formally recognized as part of the district's organizational structure.[1]

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes Restorative Practices as fundamentally centered on **relationship-building and conflict resolution rather than punitive discipline**. The district emphasizes that these practices prioritize ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community"" and ensure ""that all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts.""[1] By ""facilitating open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" the approach aims to ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[1] The district specifically targets infractions of ""disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" through these practices.[1] This philosophy represents a deliberate shift from traditional exclusionary discipline toward restorative conflict resolution.

**Infrastructure**

At the district level, OCPS has established formal infrastructure to support these practices. The **Access and Opportunity department** serves as the organizational home for Restorative Practices initiatives and can be contacted at 445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801, 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[1] Additionally, OCPS has implemented a **Civil Citation program** in partnership with law enforcement agencies, which operates as a restorative alternative to traditional juvenile justice processing for school-based incidents.[1] The district's Discipline Procedures Guide indicates that ""trained school staff members (administrators, teachers, or counselors)"" facilitate restorative practices, suggesting that training infrastructure exists, though specific coordinator titles or dedicated positions are not detailed in the available content.[5]

The OC Human Relations organization, which partners with OCPS schools, operates a **Restorative Schools Program** currently active in eight Orange County schools, providing consultation, mentoring, modeling sessions, and case management services.[2] Since 2017, this program has conducted 1,308 consultations, 826 mentoring sessions, and 538 modeling sessions, with an average resolution rate of 97% across over 1,000 referred cases.[2]

**Important Limitation**

The available content originates exclusively from the **district website**, not from Renaissance Charter School at Goldenrod's website. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice or Restorative Practices are specifically implemented at this individual school or how they may be adapted to that school's particular context. The information provided reflects district-wide policy and infrastructure only.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Westpointe Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, discipline alternatives, and positive school climates, though no direct mentions occur on the Westpointe Elementary school website itself.[1][4]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief, truncated context amid staff profiles without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[4] These uses position the terms within official program descriptions and departmental structures rather than staff listings, mission statements, or casual mentions.

The content suggests restorative practices form a core element of OCPS's disciplinary philosophy, conceptualized as proactive relationship-building and collaborative problem-solving to promote healthy interactions, teach conflict-resolution skills, and shift from punitive measures toward supportive environments that decrease suspensions and empower change.[4] Restorative justice complements this as a specific diversionary tool via law enforcement partnerships, emphasizing counseling over traditional citations for at-risk students.[1] While integrated into broader efforts like Access and Opportunity—which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive climates—these appear as strategic initiatives rather than a district-wide mandate, with a focus on resilience-building alongside mentoring and other supports.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond Civil Citation partnerships, training initiatives, or organizational centers; restorative practices are listed under the Access and Opportunity department (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), implying departmental oversight, but implementation details like training or school-specific rollout remain unstated in the content.[1][4]

"**Restorative Justice and Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), ESE Transition / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives[1][2]. The term **restorative justice** is explicitly mentioned on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings, a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff context, and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools[2].

These terms reflect a philosophy integrated into OCPS's broader educational approach to positive school climates and equity, rather than peripheral mentions. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based alternative to traditional juvenile justice responses, emphasizing root-cause intervention over punishment[1]. The Access and Opportunity page positions restorative practices as central to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, aligning with initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which builds resilience traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance[2]. This suggests OCPS views these practices as tools for collaborative problem-solving, community-building, and proactive conflict prevention, supporting overall student success and reduced exclusionary discipline.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or formal organizational structures explicitly tied to restorative justice or practices; mentions remain at the programmatic description level without implementation specifics like budgets, timelines, or personnel[1][2]. For instance, while Christopher Ludwig is listed as a mentoring contact, no restorative-specific roles are identified, and pages like Stellar Award Finalists highlight behavior specialists without linking them directly to these practices[2].

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Renaissance Charter at Crown Point**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives.[3] These terms are mentioned exclusively on four district website pages, not the specific school site: the Civil Citation page describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of issues, linking to a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like OCPS District Police.[1] The Access and Opportunity department page provides the most detailed conceptualization of **restorative practices**, framing them as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] The site map lists restorative practices under Access and Opportunity initiatives alongside climate and culture efforts like MTSS and mentoring,[1] while a Stellar Award Finalists page mentions it peripherally in a behavior specialist's profile without elaboration.[1]

These references indicate that restorative approaches form part of OCPS's philosophy for creating safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, integrated into broader educational strategies rather than standing alone as core mission statements.[3] Restorative Justice is positioned as a proactive, counseling-based alternative to traditional juvenile justice via civil citations, emphasizing root-cause intervention over punishment.[1] Restorative practices are conceptualized as relationship-centered tools for dialogue, community-building, and skill development to prevent conflicts, aligning with district commitments to resilience traits like empathy and responsible decision-making in the OCPS Mentoring program.[3] However, the mentions are program-descriptive and listing-based, not embedded in official policies, staff handbooks, or strategic plans in the scraped content, suggesting a supportive rather than centrally philosophical role.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's oversight of restorative practices as a key initiative.[3] The Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program relies on external law enforcement partnerships without mentioning internal OCPS roles or facilities.[1] Mentoring and related supports like PASS or School Support System appear alongside but are not explicitly tied to restorative implementation.[1][3]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Econ River High Charter, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation at the specific school level.**[3][1 from scraped content]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[scraped content: civil-citation] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a fragmented context amid staff recognitions; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3][scraped content: accessopportunity][scraped content: site_map][scraped content: 55601_4] These references position the terms within program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than formal policies, mission statements, or staff listings, with the Civil Citation page treating Restorative Justice as an active partnership and Access and Opportunity emphasizing proactive relationship-building.

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of OCPS's broader philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps, shifting from punitive measures toward root-cause interventions and community dialogue**, as evidenced by their placement under Access and Opportunity—a department committed to positive school cultures—and explicit ties to suspension reduction and resilience-building alongside mentoring.[3][scraped content: accessopportunity] The district conceptualizes these approaches as tools for collaborative problem-solving, personal growth, and healthier educator-student interactions, aligning with a cultural emphasis on learning from failures and collective improvement, though they appear more integrated into support systems than as a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; Restorative Practices is listed as a key initiative under Access and Opportunity without further elaboration on implementation structures.[scraped content: accessopportunity][scraped content: site_map]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of BridgePrep Academy Charter / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives to address student behavior, reduce suspensions, and foster positive school environments, though specific implementation at BridgePrep Academy Charter / Orange is not detailed in the available content.[1][3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the school-specific site. ""Restorative Justice"" appears once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of problems, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] ""Restorative practices"" is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings alongside initiatives like Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and Mentoring; on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a brief, truncated reference amid teacher profiles; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework for building relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3] These are program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

The content positions restorative practices as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments that promote resilience, collaboration, and positive cultures—echoing quotes from Solution Tree on productive school cultures.[3] Restorative Justice is conceptualized more narrowly as a diversionary counseling intervention via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize proactive community-building, dialogue, and skill development to prevent conflicts and empower growth.[1][3] This suggests a district-wide philosophy prioritizing relational accountability over punitive measures, though mentions are peripheral and lack depth on daily application or outcomes beyond suspension reduction goals.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; restorative practices are listed alongside broader efforts like Mentoring, PASS, and Vape Prevention under Access and Opportunity without further details on implementation teams or resources.[1][3] External sources note OCPS's historical training of middle school personnel on restorative justice via the Minority Achievement Office to form school-based RJ teams, yielding OSS reductions, but district pages provide no current confirmation of such supports.[1]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District of Laureate Park Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct mentions occur on the Laureate Park Elementary school website itself.[3]

These terms surface exclusively on four OCPS district web pages, not as core policy documents or mission statements but in program descriptions and site navigation. On the Civil Citation page, **Restorative Justice** is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation process for school-based events.[3] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map under Access and Opportunity department listings, alongside related efforts like mentoring and school climate initiatives; on the Access and Opportunity home page, they are framed as a framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations; and on a Stellar Award Finalists page, the term is listed incidentally without elaboration, possibly in a staff or initiative context.[3]

This usage suggests **restorative practices** form a philosophical cornerstone of OCPS's Access and Opportunity department, which seeks to narrow achievement gaps by creating safe, inclusive environments through relationship-building and proactive conflict skills, aligning with broader goals of resilience and positive culture as quoted from Solution Tree.[3] **Restorative Justice**, by contrast, is conceptualized more narrowly as an intervention for at-risk students via external partnerships, emphasizing counseling over punitive measures like arrests. While integrated into educational support structures—particularly for behavior management and suspension reduction—the terms appear peripherally rather than as a district-wide philosophy, with no evidence of school-specific adoption at Laureate Park Elementary.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's inclusion of restorative practices among initiatives like OCPS Mentoring and School Support System; the Civil Citation/Restorative Justice program relies on law enforcement collaboration without mentioning internal OCPS roles.[3]

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within discipline and school climate strategies, though specific implementation at Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy Charter is not detailed.[3][1] The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the ""Civil Citation"" page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[3] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under ""Access and Opportunity"" departments; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff listing without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[3][6]

These terms reflect an intentional philosophy within OCPS's broader educational approach, particularly under the Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like mentoring and climate support; restorative practices are conceptualized here as proactive relationship-building tools that teach interpersonal skills, promote collaborative problem-solving, and replace punitive measures with inclusive methods such as affective statements, restorative questions, and circles.[3][6] This aligns with district efforts to address discipline disparities, as seen in historical training for middle school RJ teams to cut out-of-school suspensions.[1] However, the mentions are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than core mission statements or policies, suggesting integration into support systems rather than district-wide mandates.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, or training programs; restorative practices fall under the general Access and Opportunity department (445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL), with contact via 407-317-3200 x 2003470, and the Civil Citation-linked restorative justice relies on law enforcement partnerships without mentioned school-based facilitators.[3] The content provides limited details on implementation depth, focusing on goals like suspension reduction without outcomes, examples, or school-specific applications, making it challenging to assess full-scale adoption at Lucious and Emma Nixon Academy Charter.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Castleview Elementary, incorporates both **restorative justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though these appear primarily as targeted programs and initiatives rather than a fully school-wide mandate at the elementary level.[4][1 from scraped content]

These terms surface exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Castleview Elementary school website itself. **Restorative justice** appears once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), framed as a collaborative program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and employ counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events.[1 from scraped content] **Restorative practices** is referenced three times: briefly in the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), in a Stellar Award finalist profile without direct elaboration (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is described as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and specifically targeting reductions in middle and high school suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations.[4][1 from scraped content]

This usage positions restorative approaches as part of official program descriptions within the district's **Access and Opportunity department**, which focuses on narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments, rather than as core policies, mission statements, or staff listings. The Civil Citation context ties restorative justice to diversionary interventions for legal or behavioral issues, while restorative practices align with proactive culture-building alongside initiatives like mentoring and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports).[1 from scraped content]

**Restorative justice** and practices reflect a philosophical commitment to addressing underlying student needs over punitive measures, integrated into OCPS's broader educational approach via the Access and Opportunity department's emphasis on positive cultures, resilience-building (e.g., traits like empathy, responsibility, and perseverance through OCPS Mentoring), and reduced exclusionary discipline. The district conceptualizes these as relationship-centered tools for conflict resolution, community-building, and skill development to prevent future issues, particularly in middle and high schools, though their application to elementary schools like Castleview is not specified.[4]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., restorative coordinators), named centers, training programs, or organizational units beyond the umbrella **Access and Opportunity department** (contact: 407-317-3200 x 2003470), which lists restorative practices among key initiatives like Mentoring, Classroom Management, Climate & Culture, and PASS (likely Positive Alternatives to Student Suspension). The Civil Citation program's partnership with law enforcement implies some operational support, but no training, facilitators, or elementary-specific implementation is evident.[1 from scraped content][4]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in OCPS Academic Center for Excellence / Orange County Public Schools**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-level approach to student discipline and school climate, though no evidence indicates implementation specific to the Academic Center for Excellence school.[1][3] The term **restorative justice** appears explicitly on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Orange County Sheriff's Office and Police Department; this initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrating with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) as a component under the Access and Opportunity department, and more substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures by prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promoting personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] A passing reference also occurs on the Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), likely in departmental context amid staff recognitions, but without elaboration.[1]

These mentions position restorative approaches as integrated elements of OCPS's broader philosophy on school climate and equity, rather than peripheral notes. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice reflects a rehabilitative stance over punitive measures, emphasizing counseling for underlying problems in collaboration with law enforcement.[1] The Access and Opportunity page conceptualizes restorative practices as proactive community-building tools that teach interpersonal skills, foster collaboration, and lower exclusionary discipline, aligning with the department's mission to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments.[3] This suggests a district philosophy that views these practices as central to productive school cultures, echoing quotes on positive collaboration and learning from failures.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for restorative justice; restorative practices falls under the general Access and Opportunity department without further breakdown, and the Civil Citation program links externally to juvenile justice dashboards rather than internal OCPS structures.[1][3] The limited content provides a high-level overview of intent and partnerships but lacks depth on implementation, training, or outcomes, precluding assessment of full integration at the school level.

This usage suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices form part of the district's philosophy for fostering safe, inclusive environments and shifting from punitive to restorative discipline**, aligning with broader goals in the Access and Opportunity department to narrow achievement gaps through positive climates, resilience-building, and reduced exclusions.[2] The Civil Citation partnership conceptualizes Restorative Justice as proactive counseling for at-risk students, while Restorative Practices emphasize relational community-building and proactive conflict skills, explicitly aiming to lower suspension rates and empower change—though conceptualized more for secondary schools than elementary contexts like Water Spring.[scraped content: civil-citation][scraped content: accessopportunity] No evidence indicates deep integration into core educational philosophy or school-specific policies; mentions are peripheral to main instructional content, lacking details on outcomes or expansion.

"Based on the available content provided, **it is not possible to derive meaningful intelligence about Pinecrest Academy Avalon/Orange's specific approach to Restorative Justice or related practices.**

While the user's query indicates that terms such as ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on Orange County Public Schools district webpages, the actual content excerpts provided do not contain any information specific to Pinecrest Academy Avalon/Orange. The scraped pages show only district-level references to these terms, appearing primarily on the Orange County Public Schools' general district website pages (the site map, Civil Citation page, Access and Opportunity department page, and Stellar Award Finalists page).

The district-level content indicates that Orange County Public Schools as a whole has partnered with law enforcement in a Restorative Justice program and maintains an ""Access and Opportunity"" department that oversees Restorative Practices initiatives[3][5]. However, none of the provided excerpts contain school-specific information about how Pinecrest Academy Avalon/Orange implements, participates in, or conceptualizes these approaches. The user's note that terms were found ""ONLY on the district website (4 pages), not on the school website"" further confirms that the school itself does not appear to have dedicated web content addressing Restorative Justice or Restorative Practices.

To provide a comprehensive analysis of Pinecrest Academy Avalon/Orange's approach to Restorative Justice—including their philosophy, infrastructure, staff positions, and program implementation—direct content from the school's website or specific district documentation about this school would be necessary.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices Presence**: Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Sunshine Elementary, incorporates both **Restorative Justice** and **restorative practices** as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the content provides limited details on depth of implementation at individual schools like Sunshine Elementary.[3][1 from scraped pages]

These terms appear exclusively on four district website pages, with no mentions on the Sunshine Elementary school website. **Restorative Justice** is described on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation) as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1 from scraped pages] **Restorative practices** appear on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, in a Stellar Award finalist profile (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), where it is framed as a comprehensive framework for building positive school cultures, prioritizing relationships, ensuring all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhancing personal responsibility, and reducing suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3 from search][2 from scraped pages]

The district conceptualizes these approaches as proactive tools for fostering supportive environments and resilience rather than purely punitive measures, aligning with broader initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which emphasizes traits such as self-awareness, grit, empathy, and perseverance to empower students amid adversity. This suggests **restorative practices** form part of the district's philosophy for inclusive learning and climate improvement, as evidenced by their placement under the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, healthy environments. However, mentions are primarily in program descriptions and departmental listings rather than core mission statements or policies, indicating integration into educational support systems but not as a district-wide mandate or central tenet.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational centers explicitly tied to these terms; restorative practices are listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring and MTSS without further elaboration on implementation structures.[2 from scraped pages]

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach, though specific implementation at UCP Bailes Community Academy is not detailed on available pages.** These terms appear exclusively on four OCPS district website pages, with no mentions on the school's own site. ""Restorative justice"" is referenced once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated into a Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[2] ""Restorative practices"" appears three times: on the site map under Access and Opportunity (https://www.ocps.net/site_map), listing it alongside initiatives like classroom management and MTSS; briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framing it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[2]

This usage positions restorative approaches as a core component of OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the district's Access and Opportunity department, which commits to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments via initiatives like mentoring and resilience-building.[2] Restorative practices are conceptualized not merely as discipline alternatives but as proactive tools for community-building, collaborative problem-solving, and teaching interpersonal skills to prevent future conflicts, aligning with broader goals of positive school cultures where failures become learning experiences.[2] The Civil Citation program's restorative justice element extends this to law enforcement collaborations for at-risk students, suggesting philosophical integration into behavior management rather than peripheral mentions.[2] However, the content provides no evidence of school-specific adoption at UCP Bailes Community Academy, treating these as district-level strategies listed in departmental overviews and program descriptions rather than school board policies or mission statements.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the scraped content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, restorative centers, or training programs; restorative practices are simply listed under Access and Opportunity initiatives without staff titles, specific program names beyond the Civil Citation partnership, or organizational details.[2] A related district discipline guide (not directly scraped but contextually aligned) notes trained staff like administrators, teachers, or counselors facilitating circles for offenses, allowing completion as an alternative consequence, but this remains unlinked to the academy.[6] Overall, the limited page excerpts yield a high-level district commitment without granular implementation details, precluding assessment of depth at the school level.

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Summerlake Elementary / Orange County Public Schools

## Restorative Justice Presence

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are **not part of Summerlake Elementary's individual school approach**. However, these terms are present within the broader Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) district framework. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages, not on Summerlake Elementary's school website, indicating that any restorative justice initiatives would be district-wide programs rather than school-specific implementations.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear on four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[1] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a departmental resource under the Access and Opportunity section, suggesting it is an official district initiative rather than a passing reference. The Stellar Award Finalists page mentions restorative practices in the context of teacher recognition, while the Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most comprehensive description, positioning restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's broader educational framework.

## Philosophy Assessment

Restorative Practices appear to be **integrated into the district's educational philosophy** rather than peripheral to it. The Access and Opportunity department frames restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[2] The district conceptualizes these practices as foundational to creating positive school cultures, with emphasis on ensuring ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving.""[2] This reflects a systemic commitment to reconciliation and relationship-building rather than punitive discipline. The Civil Citation program further demonstrates the district's philosophy by emphasizing counseling and identifying root causes of student behavioral issues, aligning with restorative justice principles of understanding and rehabilitation.

## Infrastructure

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices. The **Access and Opportunity department** serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives, with a dedicated contact structure (445 W. Amelia Street, Orlando, FL 32801; 407-317-3200 x 2003470).[2] Additionally, the district operates a **Restorative Justice program in partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department**, which includes a Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based cases.[1] While the search results do not provide specific information about dedicated restorative justice coordinators or specialists at the district level for Summerlake Elementary specifically, the broader district infrastructure suggests that schools within OCPS have access to restorative practices support through the Access and Opportunity department. The district also appears to integrate restorative practices with other initiatives, including mentoring programs and school climate improvement efforts.

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Mater Academy Narcoossee, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though specific implementation at the individual charter school level is not detailed in the available content.[4][1][2]** These terms appear exclusively on the district's website across four pages: ""Civil Citation"" explicitly describes **Restorative Justice** as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root problems, presented as an alternative to traditional juvenile justice via the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard[2]; ""Access and Opportunity Home"" defines **Restorative Practices** as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations—in middle and high schools[4]; the ""Site Map"" lists **Restorative Practices** under the Access and Opportunity department alongside initiatives like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention[1]; and ""Stellar Award Finalists"" mentions it peripherally without elaboration[3].

This presence suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices are integrated into the district's philosophy as proactive strategies for school climate and discipline**, shifting from punitive measures toward relationship-building, root-cause counseling, and community collaboration to foster resilience and reduce exclusions, aligning with broader departmental goals like those in Access and Opportunity for safe, inclusive environments[4][2]. The district conceptualizes **Restorative Justice** as a targeted intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while **Restorative Practices** emphasize ongoing cultural tools for dialogue, growth, and suspension reduction[4][2].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation-linked Restorative Justice initiative, training details, or organizational centers; these terms appear in program descriptions and departmental listings rather than operational blueprints[1][2][4]. The available content provides limited depth, focusing on high-level overviews without evidence of school-specific adoption or metrics, making it unclear how deeply these approaches are embedded at Mater Academy Narcoossee.

"# Restorative Justice at Mater Academy Narcoossee High School / Orange County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach to school discipline and student support, though the available content does not provide specific information about implementation at Mater Academy Narcoossee High School itself. The district has established formal programs and initiatives centered on these approaches, indicating that restorative frameworks are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy at the district level.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear across multiple OCPS district webpages rather than on school-specific pages. The terms appear in the following contexts: (1) the district's Civil Citation program page, which describes a partnership between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues[1]; (2) the Access and Opportunity department homepage, which outlines Restorative Practices as a key initiative focused on fostering positive school cultures and reducing suspensions[2]; (3) the district's site map, which lists Restorative Practices as a distinct departmental focus area; and (4) the Stellar Award Finalists page, which mentions restorative practices in the context of teacher recognition. These mentions suggest that restorative approaches are embedded within district-level policy and programming rather than presented as isolated interventions.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, Restorative Practices represent a core philosophical commitment within OCPS's approach to school climate and discipline. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as ""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment"" that prioritizes relationship-building and conflict resolution over traditional exclusionary discipline[2]. The philosophy emphasizes ensuring that ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" with the explicit goal of enhancing personal responsibility and reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools[2]. The Civil Citation program further reflects this philosophy by positioning counseling and root-cause analysis as alternatives to punitive responses, suggesting the district views behavioral issues as problems to be resolved collaboratively rather than simply punished.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established formal infrastructure to support restorative approaches. The Access and Opportunity department serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives, with a dedicated contact (Christopher Ludwig) listed for mentoring and restorative practices inquiries[2]. While the provided content does not identify specific staff positions such as restorative justice coordinators or specialists at Mater Academy Narcoossee High School, the district-level structure indicates that trained personnel and coordinated programming exist within OCPS. The Civil Citation program represents a formal partnership-based initiative involving law enforcement and school district collaboration, suggesting institutional commitment to restorative frameworks. However, the available content does not provide details about school-specific programs, dedicated staff at Mater Academy Narcoossee, or the extent to which restorative practices are operationalized at the individual school level.

**Limitations**

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine the specific extent to which Restorative Justice is implemented at Mater Academy Narcoossee High School or whether the school has dedicated staff, specialized programs, or school-level initiatives centered on these approaches. The information provided reflects district-wide philosophy and infrastructure rather than school-specific implementation details.

"# Restorative Justice at Orange County Public Schools: Audubon Park School

## Restorative Justice Presence

**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' district-wide approach**, though the available content does not provide specific evidence that these initiatives are uniquely implemented at Audubon Park School itself. The terms appear exclusively on district-level web pages rather than on school-specific pages, indicating that restorative approaches are district initiatives rather than school-specific programs.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across four district web pages: the Civil Citation page, the Site Map, the Stellar Award Finalists page, and the Access and Opportunity Home page. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative: ""The Orange County School District has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department in creating a program called Restorative Justice, which identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[6] The Site Map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a subsection under the ""Access and Opportunity"" department, positioning it within the district's broader climate and culture initiatives.[1] The Access and Opportunity Home page provides the most substantive description, framing restorative practices as a key initiative within the district's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps and fostering safe, healthy, and inclusive learning environments.[3]

## Philosophy Assessment

Restorative Practices appear to be integrated into Orange County Public Schools' educational philosophy as a deliberate, district-sanctioned approach rather than a peripheral mention. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as **""a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate a positive and supportive school environment""** that prioritizes relationship-building and conflict resolution.[3] The philosophy emphasizes ensuring that ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" with the explicit goal of enhancing personal responsibility and reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.[3] The district's partnership with law enforcement on the Civil Citation program demonstrates that restorative justice is viewed as a preventative, counseling-based approach to student discipline that addresses underlying causes rather than relying solely on punitive measures.[6]

## Infrastructure

The available content indicates that restorative practices are housed within the **Access and Opportunity department**, which operates from 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando and can be reached at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[3] However, the provided content does not identify dedicated staff positions such as restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists at the district or school level, nor does it describe specific restorative justice centers, programs, or training initiatives. The district's partnership with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department on the Civil Citation program represents an organizational structure for implementing restorative justice, but specific implementation details, staff roles, or school-based infrastructure are not detailed in the available content.

## Limitations

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether Restorative Justice is uniquely or distinctively implemented at Audubon Park School specifically. The information provided reflects only district-level initiatives and philosophy. To understand how restorative practices are operationalized at the school level—including dedicated staff, specific programs, or school-based training—would require access to school-specific documentation or pages.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Innovation High / Orange**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district programs rather than a district-wide philosophy or core policy[1][4]. The term **restorative justice** is mentioned once on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), describing a specific partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department that identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root problems, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on three pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives[1]; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a staff profile context without elaboration[1]; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, enhance personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions in middle and high schools for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations[4].

These references suggest restorative practices form a peripheral element of OCPS's philosophy, conceptualized as proactive tools for climate and culture improvement within the Access and Opportunity department, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and resilience-building[4]. Restorative justice, however, is narrower, limited to the Civil Citation program's counseling focus without evidence of broader philosophical integration like mission statements or strategic plans[1]. No content indicates these approaches as central to educational philosophy; they appear as program descriptions and passing mentions amid broader efforts like mentoring and MTSS, without links to Innovation High specifically[1][4].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident, such as staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named centers, training programs, or organizational structures; terms are not tied to specific roles beyond general department initiatives like PASS or School Support System[1][4]. The Civil Citation program implies collaboration with external law enforcement but lacks details on internal implementation[1].

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) district-wide approach**, appearing as targeted programs and initiatives aimed at addressing student behavior through counseling, relationship-building, and conflict resolution rather than solely punitive measures.

The term **restorative justice** is mentioned specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to identify troubled students and use counseling to address root causes of problems, linked to the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity department listings, on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4), though the latter cuts off without further detail. On the Access and Opportunity page, restorative practices are framed as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools.[1]

This indicates **integration into the district's educational philosophy**, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's focus on safe, inclusive environments and narrowing achievement gaps through positive cultures. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive intervention for at-risk students via law enforcement partnerships, while restorative practices emphasize ongoing relationship maintenance, collaborative problem-solving, and social-emotional skill-building to prevent escalation, aligning with broader goals like resilience and mentorship in the same department.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named centers, or training programs; mentions are limited to general program descriptions and departmental listings without implementation specifics like trained facilitators or protocols.[1] Restorative practices are noted as facilitated by school staff in a related district document, using methods like affective statements, restorative questions, community-building circles, and conflict resolution circles for offenses like disrespect or altercations, potentially serving as alternatives to traditional discipline.[6]

"Based on the available content from Orange County Public Schools' district website, **Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices are clearly part of the district's approach to school discipline and school culture**, though the specific implementation at Luminary Middle School cannot be determined from the provided materials.

## Contextual Understanding

The terms appear across multiple district-level web pages rather than school-specific pages. ""Restorative practices"" is listed as a key initiative within the Access and Opportunity department on the district's site map and is featured prominently on the Access and Opportunity homepage. ""Restorative justice"" appears on the Civil Citation page, where it is described as a district-wide partnership program. These references indicate that Restorative Justice is integrated into the district's official infrastructure and policy framework, not mentioned peripherally.

## Philosophy Assessment

The district conceptualizes Restorative Practices as **a comprehensive framework designed to cultivate positive and supportive school environments** that prioritize relationship-building and conflict resolution over traditional punitive measures.[4] According to the district's Access and Opportunity department, Restorative Practices aim to ""significantly decrease school suspensions related to the key infractions of disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" while teaching ""essential interpersonal and conflict-resolution skills.""[4] The district's Civil Citation program further demonstrates this philosophy by identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of behavioral issues, representing a shift from exclusionary discipline toward restorative approaches.[4]

## Infrastructure

The district has established formal infrastructure to support Restorative Practices. The Access and Opportunity department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, serves as the organizational hub for these initiatives and can be contacted at 407-317-3200 x 2003470.[4] Restorative Practices are listed as a key initiative within this department's portfolio, alongside mentoring and other school climate initiatives. Additionally, the district has partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department to implement the Restorative Justice program, which identifies at-risk students and provides counseling support.[4]

However, the provided content does not include specific information about dedicated staff positions, program names, or training initiatives specific to Luminary Middle School, nor does it detail whether this particular school has implemented these district-level programs.

"# Restorative Justice at Orange County Public Schools: District-Level Analysis

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are established components of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) disciplinary and school climate framework. These approaches appear as official district initiatives rather than school-specific programs, indicating district-wide adoption and implementation across multiple schools.

**Contextual Understanding**

The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear across multiple OCPS district webpages, though notably not on individual school websites. References were found on the district's Civil Citation page, the Access and Opportunity department homepage, the site map, and in Stellar Award finalist materials. On the Civil Citation page, restorative justice is presented as a partnership initiative between OCPS, the Sheriff's Office, and Police Department, described as a program that ""identifies troubled students and uses counseling to get to the root of the problem.""[3] The Access and Opportunity department, which serves as the primary hub for these initiatives, features restorative practices as a key initiative under the heading ""Restorative Practices: Fostering Positive School Cultures and Reducing Suspensions.""[3] The site map lists ""Restorative Practices"" as a navigational item under the Access and Opportunity department, indicating its formal status within district organizational structure.[6]

**Philosophy Assessment**

OCPS conceptualizes restorative practices as a comprehensive framework centered on relationship-building and conflict resolution rather than exclusionary discipline. According to the district's official description, restorative practices prioritize ""the development and maintenance of strong relationships among all members of the school community, with the ultimate goal of reducing suspension rates in middle and high schools.""[3] The district emphasizes that these practices ensure ""all voices are heard when addressing and resolving conflicts"" through ""open dialogue and collaborative problem-solving,"" which ""enhance personal responsibility and empower individuals to initiate positive change and growth.""[3] Specifically, OCPS targets suspensions related to ""disrespect, insubordination, and altercations"" through restorative approaches.[3] The philosophy reflects a shift from traditional punitive discipline toward rehabilitative and community-focused responses, with the district positioning restorative practices as integral to creating ""positive, productive school cultures"" that contribute to student and teacher success.

**Infrastructure**

The Access and Opportunity department serves as the organizational hub for restorative practices implementation within OCPS.[3] This department, located at 445 W. Amelia Street in Orlando, operates under a broader mission of narrowing achievement gaps and maintaining ""safe, healthy, and inclusive learning and working environments.""[3] While the provided content does not specify dedicated restorative justice coordinator positions, staff titles, or school-specific restorative justice centers at individual schools like Olympus Academy Charter School, the district-level infrastructure is evident through the formal departmental structure and the integration of restorative practices into official discipline procedures and school climate initiatives. The district has also established partnerships with law enforcement agencies (Sheriff's Office and Police Department) to implement restorative justice programs that identify at-risk students and provide counseling-based interventions.[3]

"**Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, though the available content provides limited details on implementation specifics for Orlando Science Charter School K-8.** These terms appear exclusively on the OCPS district website across four pages, with no mentions on the school's own site. On the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), **restorative justice** is described as a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department, targeting ""troubled students"" through counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events[1]. The term **restorative practices** appears on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity departments, on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), and in a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) highlighting a behavior specialist. These are program descriptions and departmental listings rather than formal policies or mission statements, with the Access and Opportunity page providing the most detail: it frames **restorative practices** as a ""comprehensive framework"" to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspension rates in middle and high schools[1].

This suggests **restorative justice and practices are integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy as proactive alternatives to traditional discipline**, emphasizing root-cause counseling, community dialogue, and resilience-building within broader initiatives like Access and Opportunity, which aims to narrow achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments. The Civil Citation context positions restorative justice as a diversionary tool for behavioral offenses, while restorative practices align with cultural goals like collaboration and growth mindset, as quoted from Solution Tree. However, the mentions are peripheral—lacking deep elaboration on daily application—and do not confirm centrality to the district's core philosophy or specific adoption at Orlando Science Charter School K-8.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as named coordinators, facilitators, training programs, centers, or organizational units beyond the Access and Opportunity department's inclusion of restorative practices alongside initiatives like OCPS Mentoring (focusing on resilience traits including empathy and responsibility). Staff examples, like behavior specialist Lauren Fiallo recognized for interventions, imply supportive roles but do not explicitly tie to restorative justice training or positions. Overall, the content offers a high-level endorsement without sufficient detail to assess depth of implementation or school-level practices.

"**Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices in Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), District for Atwater Bay Elementary**

Restorative Justice and restorative practices are part of Orange County Public Schools' (OCPS) approach, appearing as targeted initiatives within district-level programs focused on student behavior, school climate, and discipline alternatives, though no direct evidence ties them specifically to Atwater Bay Elementary.[3]

The term **restorative justice** appears once on the ""Civil Citation"" page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), described in the context of a formal district program partnered with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department. This initiative identifies troubled students and employs counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with Florida Department of Juvenile Justice's Civil Citation Dashboard for tracking school-based events by agencies like Orlando Police Department, Orange County Sheriff's Office, and OCPS District Police. In contrast, **restorative practices** is mentioned three times: on the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under ""Access and Opportunity"" departments; briefly on a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) amid listings of school support systems without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), framed as a comprehensive framework to build positive school cultures, reduce suspensions (especially for disrespect, insubordination, and altercations), prioritize relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, and teach interpersonal skills.[3] These mentions occur in program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than official policies, mission statements, or staff listings.

This content positions restorative approaches as integrated into OCPS's educational philosophy, particularly within the Access and Opportunity department's commitment to narrowing achievement gaps through safe, inclusive environments and positive cultures. Restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive counseling-based diversion from traditional juvenile justice, while restorative practices emphasize relationship-building, dialogue, and accountability to foster resilience and cut suspension rates in middle and high schools—aligning with broader initiatives like OCPS Mentoring, which promotes traits such as empathy, responsibility, and perseverance.[3] However, the references are descriptive rather than deeply philosophical, suggesting peripheral but intentional embedding in climate and culture strategies rather than a district-wide mandate.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond Civil Citation, training initiatives, or organizational units solely for these practices; restorative practices is listed alongside other Access and Opportunity efforts like Mentoring, MTSS, and Vape Prevention without further details on implementation, staffing, or facilities.[3]

"**Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), the district encompassing Windermere High School, incorporates both Restorative Justice and Restorative Practices as elements of its disciplinary and cultural approach, though the available content provides limited details on depth of implementation.**[3]

The term **Restorative Justice** appears specifically on the Civil Citation page (https://www.ocps.net/civil-citation), where it describes a partnership program with the Sheriff's Office and Police Department aimed at identifying troubled students and using counseling to address root causes of issues, integrated with the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice Civil Citation Dashboard for school-based events.[1] In contrast, **Restorative Practices** is mentioned on three district pages: the site map (https://www.ocps.net/site_map) under Access and Opportunity initiatives; a Stellar Award Finalists page (https://www.ocps.net/55601_4) in a generic departmental context without elaboration; and most substantively on the Access and Opportunity home page (https://www.ocps.net/accessopportunity), which positions it as a comprehensive framework to foster positive school cultures, build relationships, ensure all voices are heard in conflict resolution, promote personal responsibility, and reduce suspensions—particularly for infractions like disrespect, insubordination, and altercations in middle and high schools.[3] These references frame the terms within official program descriptions and departmental overviews rather than policies, staff listings, or mission statements, with Restorative Justice tied to law enforcement collaboration and Restorative Practices to proactive school climate efforts.

This suggests **Restorative Justice and Practices are part of the district's philosophy, conceptualized as relationship-focused alternatives to punitive discipline** to support student well-being and reduce exclusions, aligning with broader goals of safe, inclusive environments under Access and Opportunity.[3] However, the mentions are not deeply integrated into core educational approaches; they appear as targeted initiatives rather than district-wide mandates, with Restorative Practices linked to fostering resilience alongside mentoring programs emphasizing traits like empathy and responsible decision-making.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or specialists), named programs beyond the Civil Citation partnership, training initiatives, or organizational structures; Restorative Practices is simply listed as a key initiative without implementation details.[3]

"**Paragraph 1 - Philosophy and Conceptualization:** The Pasco County Schools, encompassing the PASCO VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION PROGRAM (DISTRICT PROVIDED), conceptualizes **restorative practices** within a broader philosophy of proactive, relationship-centered discipline that prioritizes prevention over punitive measures, as evidenced in their anti-bullying policies and overarching behavioral frameworks. On the ""Stop Bullying - Information and Reporting"" webpage, **restorative practices** are implicitly positioned as a counterpoint to traditional disciplinary actions like suspension or expulsion for harassment, bullying, and hazing, which are framed as serious violations of the **Student Code of Conduct** that disrupt educational performance and school operations. This approach aligns with the district's commitment to fostering positive relationships among students, staff, and families as a preventative factor against problem behaviors, integrating **restorative practices** with initiatives like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) embedded in a Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS), Social Emotional Learning (SEL), and Trauma Informed Care. These concepts interconnect to promote resiliency skills—such as managing emotions, compassion, and empathy—through universal instruction and tiered interventions, reflecting a high level of commitment to a compassionate educational environment without specified timelines or explicit goals on the analyzed pages, though district documents emphasize ongoing embedding in instructional practices.[3][4]

**Paragraph 2 - Infrastructure and Implementation:** Despite the philosophical emphasis on **restorative practices**, the provided content from the school's anti-bullying webpage reveals no concrete infrastructure, dedicated programs, staffing, or operational systems explicitly tied to their implementation, indicating that these remain primarily conceptual rather than fully operationalized within the visible PASCO VIRTUAL INSTRUCTION PROGRAM materials. No specific centers, departments, academies, positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), training schedules, or timelines are mentioned on the two identical ""Stop Bullying"" pages, which focus instead on reporting mechanisms, definitions of harassment/hazing, and general disciplinary consequences under the **Student Code of Conduct**, with a ""Click Here to Report Bullying"" link but no reference to restorative circles, mediation processes, or specialized personnel. Broader district supports like PBIS/MTSS and SEL networks are noted in related documents for coaching and interventions, yet the school-specific pages lack tangible elements such as program names, staff roles, or implementation protocols, suggesting that translation from philosophy to practice occurs at the district level through Student Support Programs and Services (SSPS) without dedicated virtual program structures delineated here.[1][3][4]

"**Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' approach, particularly within the district's School Psychological Services framework, though details on its full implementation remain limited in the available content.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears specifically on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the section ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates."" It is presented alongside related strategies such as ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports,"" indicating its role in broader efforts to prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, assess school climate, and provide crisis intervention[3]. This is not a passing mention but part of a structured description of school psychologists' responsibilities, which emphasize partnering with families, teachers, and administrators to foster safe learning environments through mental health, behavior management, and positive interventions like problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, and resilience-building[3]. No mentions occur on the Geneva Elementary School website itself; all findings are district-level[1-8].

This inclusion suggests restorative justice aligns with the district's core philosophy for promoting positive behavior and mental health, integrated into school psychologists' work to improve communication, social skills, peer relationships, and school-wide practices rather than treated peripherally[3]. School psychologists are described as applying expertise to help students succeed academically, socially, behaviorally, and emotionally by individualizing interventions, reducing special education referrals, and coordinating community services, with restorative justice framed as a proactive tool for positive discipline and school connectedness[3]. Related concepts appear elsewhere, such as ""Restorative Practices"" in a School Improvement Plan (SIP) for an alternative program (Endeavor), where professional learning communities focus on trauma-informed care and restorative practices alongside behavioral interventions[5], and broader mental health supports via school social workers and counselors[4][6].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed for restorative justice. There are no mentions of specific staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, named programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, or formal training initiatives exclusively for it; instead, it falls under general school psychological services, with contact provided for the department (407.320.0216)[3]. School psychologists handle its promotion alongside positive behavioral supports, while school social workers address related areas like attendance and truancy[4]. Other district efforts, like the Seminole Resilient Community Project with resiliency workshops and youth summits, complement this philosophically but do not reference restorative justice directly[2].

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Lawton Elementary School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and school climate, though the available content does not provide specific information about how this approach is implemented at Lawton Elementary School individually. The district explicitly incorporates restorative justice as a component of its broader student support and behavioral management framework.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is mentioned as part of the district's commitment to creating safe, positive school climates. Specifically, the page states that school psychological services work to ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a core function.[3] This reference appears within the context of official district policy and service descriptions rather than as a peripheral mention. The term is integrated into the district's formal description of how school psychologists and psychological services support schools in achieving their educational and behavioral goals.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative justice appears to be embedded within SCPS's philosophy of positive behavioral support and school climate improvement. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a complement to traditional discipline, positioning it alongside ""positive discipline"" as a deliberate strategy for addressing student behavior. This approach reflects a philosophy that emphasizes accountability, community responsibility, and student growth rather than purely punitive measures. The district's broader mental health and intervention services framework—which includes school psychologists, school social workers, and counselors—suggests that restorative justice is understood as part of a comprehensive, supportive approach to student behavior and school safety.[3]

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that restorative justice implementation is supported through the district's School Psychological Services department, which employs school psychologists who are responsible for implementing and promoting restorative justice practices.[3] Additionally, the district operates Professional Learning Communities that ""focus on trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans,"" suggesting ongoing staff training and coordination around these approaches.[5] However, the provided content does not identify dedicated restorative justice coordinators, specialized centers, or school-specific programs at Lawton Elementary. The infrastructure appears to be integrated into existing student support services rather than housed in a standalone department or program.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, as it is listed among the responsibilities of school psychologists in creating safe, positive school climates.[4]

**Contextual Understanding**: The term ""restorative justice"" appears solely on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), within a bulleted list under ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates."" It is mentioned alongside related practices such as ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports,"" as well as efforts to prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, assess school climate, identify at-risk students, and provide crisis intervention.[4] This positions it as one component of broader school psychologist duties aimed at fostering supportive environments, rather than as a standalone policy, program description, staff listing, or mission statement. No other pages, including those on intervention services, mental health, alternative programs, or initiatives, reference restorative justice or closely related terms like restorative practices.[1][5][6][7][8]

**Philosophy Assessment**: Restorative Justice appears peripherally integrated into SCPS's educational philosophy through the school psychologists' role in promoting positive behavior, mental health, and safe climates, rather than as a core or deeply embedded element.[4] The district conceptualizes it as a proactive strategy for discipline and behavioral support, paired with positive behavioral interventions and social-emotional learning, to enhance school connectedness and reduce vulnerabilities. This aligns with the psychologists' overarching expertise in mental health, learning, and behavior to help students succeed academically, socially, and emotionally, but lacks detailed explanation of its principles, such as repairing harm or building relationships, indicating it is not a fully articulated philosophical pillar.[4]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated infrastructure for Restorative Justice is evident in the content, such as specific staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs, centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments.[4] School psychologists are tasked with implementing and promoting it alongside other supports like positive discipline and behavioral interventions, but they serve broader roles in assessments, counseling, and family partnerships without specialization in restorative practices.[4][5][7] Related efforts, such as school-wide positive behavioral supports or social-emotional learning, exist district-wide but do not explicitly connect to restorative justice infrastructure.[4][6][7]

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly integrated with positive behavioral supports and school psychological services, though it is not explicitly detailed as a standalone program at Bear Lake Elementary School.** The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed among key responsibilities such as implementing and promoting positive discipline, school-wide positive behavioral supports, and assessing school climate to improve connectedness[5]. Related terms like ""Restorative Practices"" (often used interchangeably in context) are mentioned more extensively in district School Improvement Plans (SIPs), including those for elementary-level schools, where they describe non-punitive methods to repair harm, restore relationships, and manage conflict through student circles, conferencing, and classroom implementation with fidelity[1][2][6]. These references occur in official program descriptions and action plans rather than mission statements or staff listings, emphasizing their role alongside Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS), MTSS, and social-emotional learning to foster positive school climates, reduce discipline disparities, and support at-risk students[1][2][3][5].

This approach reflects a core philosophical commitment within SCPS to proactive, relationship-focused discipline over traditional punitive measures, conceptualized as tools for promoting positive behavior, mental health, emotional resilience, and conflict resolution[1][5][6]. Restorative Practices are not peripheral but embedded in broader strategies like PBIS: MTSS—a district-wide, research-based multi-tiered system implemented across all schools, with 20 designated model sites, to minimize suspensions and enhance academic performance[3]. For instance, SIPs outline using restorative methods to address unfavorable school safety survey responses on fair discipline (e.g., 49% unfavorable in one case) and integrate them with phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change”[1][2].

Infrastructure supporting this includes school psychologists who directly implement and promote restorative justice alongside positive behavioral supports and crisis intervention[5], district-wide PBIS training for all school staff[3], and action plans mandating classroom walkthroughs, teacher check-ins, and MTSS team monitoring for fidelity[1]. Additional elements encompass professional development on restorative practices and trauma-informed care via Professional Learning Communities[6], Behavior Interventionists enhancing PBIS[2], and programs like the Ram Initiative for at-risk student advocacy[1]. No dedicated restorative justice coordinators, centers, or Bear Lake-specific programs are named, but these align with district MTSS and Early Warning systems required for K-8 schools[1][7].

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly at Sanford Middle School, as evidenced by district-wide psychological services promoting it alongside school-specific implementation in improvement plans.** The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" paired with ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports"" and efforts to ""assess school climate and improve school connectedness.""[6] Relatedly, Sanford Middle School's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP) emphasizes ""**Restorative Practices**,"" distinguishing it slightly from ""restorative justice"" but describing it as a method to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships,"" using ""circles and conferencing"" to give students a voice.[1] This SIP integrates it with PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) and Conditions for Learning, including goals like ""Using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" monitored via teacher check-ins, MTSS team documentation, and administrative walkthroughs.[1] Earlier SIPs, such as one from 2021, reference professional development on ""**restorative practices**"" within trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions.[7]

This presence reflects a core philosophical integration into SCPS's educational approach, conceptualized as a proactive, positive discipline strategy to foster mental health, behavior management, and social-emotional learning rather than punitive measures. School psychologists are positioned to promote it district-wide to create ""safe, healthy, and supportive learning environments,"" supporting positive behavior, resilience, conflict resolution, and peer relationships.[6] At Sanford Middle School, it forms part of a cohesive framework with PBIS—using phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change”—to reinforce positive choices, link struggling students to interventions like the Ram Initiative Program, and address social-emotional development through mental health lessons.[1] This suggests restorative justice/practices are not peripheral mentions but embedded in school-wide policies and MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), aligning with broader goals to reduce special education referrals and improve academic engagement.[6][1]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, or standalone centers; instead, implementation relies on existing roles like school psychologists, MTSS teams, PBIS teams, administrators, and faculty volunteers via the Ram Initiative.[1][6] Professional development is noted for behavioral interventions and restorative practices, including PLCs (Professional Learning Communities) focused on trauma-informed care, but without named training programs or organizational units.[7][1] Monitoring occurs through tools like EdInsight for check-ins and classroom observations to ensure fidelity.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, along with related terms like restorative practices, is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within the district's School Psychological Services and school-level improvement plans, where it is promoted as a key strategy for positive discipline and behavior management.[1][6]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed among core responsibilities such as ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports.""[6] It is framed in the context of supporting mental health, behavior management, and creating safe learning environments through school psychologists' work with students, families, teachers, and administrators. Relatedly, ""Restorative Practices"" is detailed in English Estates Elementary School's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP), where the school commits to incorporating it alongside Conditions for Learning and PBIS to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships,"" using methods like circles and conferencing.[1] Another SCPS school's SIP similarly emphasizes faculty training on restorative practice implementation to foster positive behavior supports.[7] These mentions occur in official program descriptions and strategic planning documents, not as passing references or staff listings, indicating intentional integration into district-wide and school-specific initiatives.

This approach aligns with SCPS's broader philosophy of positive behavior interventions, as seen in their Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS) framework, which provides research-based alternatives to traditional discipline like suspensions, emphasizing student motivation, social skills, conflict resolution, and resilience—outcomes restorative justice explicitly supports.[4][6] Restorative practices are conceptualized as tools for repairing harm, giving students a voice, and reinforcing positive relationships, integrated into multi-tiered systems like MTSS for at-risk students rather than treated peripherally.[1][6] For English Estates Elementary, it connects to initiatives like the Ram Initiative Program for advocacy, Mental Health Wellness Lessons, and PBIS mottos such as “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change,” with fidelity measures including classroom check-ins, walkthroughs, and student interviews to ensure restorative practice use.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, Restorative Justice Centers, or named training programs, is detailed in the content; instead, implementation relies on existing roles like school psychologists, MTSS teams, administrators, and general faculty trained in PBS across all SCPS schools.[1][4][6][7] Schools like English Estates track progress through tools like EdInsight and quarterly MTSS/SST meetings, with volunteers from staff supporting at-risk students, but without specialized positions or centers mentioned.

"**Restorative Justice is referenced as part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach to creating safe school climates, though it is not explicitly detailed as a core program at Casselberry Elementary School specifically.** The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section alongside initiatives like preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, and identifying at-risk students.[4] Here, it is presented as one of several strategies that school psychologists promote to foster positive discipline and school connectedness, without further elaboration on implementation, training, or specific practices. This mention is part of a broader program description outlining the roles of school psychologists, who partner with families, teachers, and administrators to enhance mental health, behavior management, and academic success, rather than an official policy, staff listing, or mission statement.[4]

This district-level reference suggests restorative justice aligns peripherally with SCPS's philosophy of positive behavioral interventions and mental health support, conceptualized as a tool for improving school climate and reducing vulnerabilities, integrated into psychological services that emphasize conflict resolution, resilience, and peer relationships.[4] However, it does not appear deeply embedded in the district's educational core, as the page focuses more on assessments, counseling, and family partnerships without defining restorative justice or linking it to outcomes like reduced discipline referrals. Related concepts like **restorative practices** emerge more prominently in school improvement plans (SIPs) from other SCPS schools, such as Journeys Academy (a restorative practices school using daily circles and coaching sessions), Bentley Elementary (incorporating practices into daily routines and professional development), and Endeavor (via professional learning communities on trauma-informed care).[1][2][6] These examples indicate a district philosophy shifting toward community-focused discipline, but no such integration is evident for Casselberry Elementary.

No dedicated infrastructure for restorative justice is identified in the content related to Casselberry Elementary or SCPS broadly; there are no mentions of specialized staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational departments tied to it.[1][2][4][6] School psychologists provide the closest support through general behavioral interventions, but this lacks specificity to restorative methods.[4] Overall, the available content offers limited insight into a structured approach at Casselberry Elementary, with restorative justice appearing as a promoted but underdeveloped element of district psychological services.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, often referenced interchangeably with restorative practices in district materials, forms an explicit component of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach to student support and discipline, particularly at South Seminole Middle School within the district.[1][4]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under efforts to ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" alongside initiatives like implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, preventing bullying, and supporting social-emotional learning; it is promoted as part of positive discipline strategies by school psychologists who consult on mental health, behavior, and school-wide policies.[4] Related term ""restorative practices"" features prominently in South Seminole Middle School's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP), where the school commits to incorporating it with Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS) and Conditions for Learning to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships through student-centered processes like circles and conferencing.[1] The SIP details action steps such as using restorative practice in classrooms with fidelity, including student check-ins documented in EdInsight, administrative walkthroughs, and interviews to verify implementation.[1] Other school SIPs in the district, such as those from 2023 and 2021, reinforce this by outlining faculty training on restorative practices, integration into professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care, and alignment with behavior intervention plans.[5][6]

This approach integrates restorative justice into the district's core philosophy for fostering positive behavior, mental health, and safe environments, as evidenced by school psychologists' role in promoting it district-wide and South Seminole Middle School's strategic emphasis on it as a tool for social-emotional development, at-risk student advocacy via the Ram Initiative Program, and PBIS phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change.”[1][4] The district conceptualizes it as a proactive, relationship-focused method to improve communication, conflict resolution, resilience, and peer relationships, rather than exclusionary discipline, with ties to broader Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) and early warning systems compliant with Florida statutes.[1][4]

No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative justice coordinators or specialists, are named; instead, implementation involves general roles like school psychologists, MTSS teams, administrators, teachers, PBIS teams, and volunteers in programs like the Ram Initiative.[1][4] Programs include restorative practices circles and conferencing at South Seminole Middle School, school-wide PBIS, MTSS interventions, and online mental health lessons, with training provided to faculty (e.g., annually or as needed for behavior intervention plans) and monitored through walkthroughs and data tools like EdInsight.[1][5] Organizational support stems from Student Support Services, including School Psychological Services, without mention of standalone centers or departments.[4]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, alongside related terms like restorative practices, is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within Jackson Heights Middle School's framework, as evidenced by district-wide promotions and school-specific implementation plans.

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports and social-emotional learning initiatives[1][6]. This positions it within official program descriptions for psychological services supporting student mental health, behavior, and school climate. At the school level, Jackson Heights Middle School's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP) emphasizes ""**Restorative Practices**,"" defining it as a method to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships"" through student circles, conferencing, and classroom integration, integrated with PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports) and Conditions for Learning[1]. The SIP commits to ""Using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" including MTSS team check-ins, teacher documentation, and administrative walkthroughs[1]. Earlier SIPs reference training on restorative practices within professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions[8].

This integration suggests Restorative Justice forms a core element of the district's and school's philosophy for positive behavior, mental health promotion, and conflict resolution, conceptualized as proactive tools to build relationships, reinforce coping skills, and reduce exclusions rather than peripheral mentions. School psychologists partner to ""promote positive peer relationships and social problem-solving,"" aligning restorative approaches with broader goals of academic achievement, diverse learner support, and family-school partnerships[6]. At Jackson Heights, it ties into the ""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"" PBIS phrase, Ram Initiative for at-risk students, and mental health lessons[1].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, Restorative Justice centers, or standalone programs; instead, implementation relies on existing structures like school psychologists, MTSS teams, PBIS teams, administrators, and faculty volunteers for advocacy[1][6]. Training occurs through faculty professional development, including annual sessions on restorative practices, behavior intervention plans, and PLCs[1][7][8]. The district's psychological services department provides the organizational backbone, with contact via 407.320.0216 for coordination[6].

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, primarily referenced as ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" in district psychological services descriptions and multiple school improvement plans (SIPs), though not explicitly on Midway Elementary School's website.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under responsibilities of school psychologists as ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports (PBIS), social-emotional learning, and crisis intervention[1][6]. This positions it within a broader framework of mental health and behavioral support services. Related term ""restorative practices"" (often used interchangeably) features prominently in SCPS SIPs for 2023-2024, such as Midway Elementary's plan (school code 0071), which commits to implementing Conditions for Learning, PBIS, and **Restorative Practices** to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships via circles and conferencing[1]. Similar integrations appear in other SCPS SIPs, including goals for classroom use with fidelity (e.g., check-ins documented in EdInsight, administrator walkthroughs), advisories with restorative lessons, reducing unfavorable safety survey responses on fair discipline, and faculty training to foster positive environments[2][7][9].

This reflects integration into SCPS's educational philosophy as a core positive behavior and mental health strategy, conceptualized as non-punitive methods to improve communication, social skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and peer relationships, often paired with PBIS (""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"") and MTSS for at-risk students[1][6]. School psychologists promote it district-wide to create supportive environments, with SIPs emphasizing fidelity in classrooms and links to interventions like Behavior Intervention Plans (BIPs), Ram Initiative advocacy, and mental health lessons[1][2][7].

Infrastructure includes school psychologists as key implementers for promotion and support[6]; PBIS teams for expectations and positive reinforcement[1]; MTSS/SST teams for check-ins, progress monitoring, and BIPs[1][7]; behavior interventionists enhancing PBIS[2]; and annual/ongoing training for staff on restorative practices, trauma-informed care, and classroom management[7][8]. No dedicated coordinators, centers, or school-specific programs for Midway Elementary are named, but SIPs outline monitoring via walkthroughs, student interviews, and data tools like EdInsight[1].

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly once on the Seminole County Public Schools district website, but the available content cuts off abruptly without further elaboration, making it impossible to confirm whether it forms a clear or integrated part of the district's or Endeavor School's approach to student support or discipline.[1]

This single mention occurs on the ""School Psychological Services"" page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), within a detailed description of school psychologists' roles in promoting positive behavior and mental health. Specifically, it is listed alongside other interventions such as ""Promote problem-solving, anger management, and **restorative justice**,"" as one of the strategies psychologists use to improve students’ communication and social skills, assess emotional and behavioral needs, provide counseling, and reinforce coping skills. The context frames it as part of direct support to students and consultations with teachers and families, rather than as an official policy, standalone program, mission statement, or staff listing; it resembles a passing reference in a broader list of mental health promotion activities, with no additional explanation or examples provided in the scraped content.[1]

No evidence indicates that restorative justice is central to the district's or school's philosophy. The isolated mention suggests it may be acknowledged peripherally as a tool within school psychologists' expertise for addressing behavior and relationships, but the content does not conceptualize it further—lacking definitions, goals, or connections to broader educational aims like academic achievement or diverse learner support. Without expansion, it does not appear integrated into the described approach, which emphasizes assessments, individualized interventions, and positive behavior promotion more generally.[1]

The content reveals no dedicated infrastructure for restorative justice, such as specialized staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs, training initiatives, centers, or organizational structures. School psychologists are highlighted as key personnel providing related supports like counseling and conflict resolution, with contact information (407.320.0216) for their services, but nothing ties this explicitly to restorative justice implementation.[1] Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine a meaningful approach, as the single, incomplete reference provides insufficient detail to assess philosophy, implementation, or commitment.

Relatedly, ""restorative practices"" emerges in multiple school-specific School Improvement Plans (SIPs) from the district's SIM portal, such as Winter Springs Elementary's 2023-2024 SIP (school code 0071), which commits to ""incorporate and continue to implement... **Restorative Practices**"" to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships through student circles and conferencing.[1] Another SIP for a different school (0931) details faculty training on ""**restorative practice**"" implementation to foster positive environments, while others reference it in professional development on trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions.[6][7]

This integration suggests restorative justice forms a core element of the district's philosophy for positive behavior and mental health support, conceptualized as a non-punitive strategy to promote problem-solving, conflict resolution, peer relationships, and resilience, often paired with PBIS, MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), and initiatives like the Ram Initiative Program for at-risk students.[1][5][7] It aligns with school psychologists' broader role in creating supportive learning environments by reinforcing positive coping skills and coordinating services, indicating a district-wide educational approach rather than a peripheral mention.[5]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Goldsboro Elementary Magnet / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach to school discipline and student support, though the available content does not provide school-specific information about Goldsboro Elementary Magnet's individual implementation of these practices.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), specifically within a section titled ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates."" In this context, restorative justice is listed alongside other discipline and climate-building strategies as part of the district's comprehensive approach to student support. The reference appears within a broader description of how school psychologists work to ""implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as part of their role in creating safer school environments[3].

Additionally, restorative practices are mentioned in a school improvement plan document, where Professional Learning Communities are described as focusing on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans""[6]. This indicates that restorative practices are integrated into professional development and ongoing staff training at the district level.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice appears to be integrated into Seminole County Public Schools' broader philosophy of positive, evidence-based discipline rather than presented as a standalone initiative. The district explicitly positions restorative justice as an alternative to traditional punitive discipline methods. The Positive Behavior Support (PBS) framework, which is implemented across 20 district schools designated as MODEL schools, is described as ""consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which advocates the use of positive behavior interventions and school-based disciplinary strategies that reduce or eliminate the need to use suspension and expulsion as disciplinary options""[4]. Restorative justice fits within this larger ecosystem of preventative, relationship-based approaches to student behavior and school climate.

**Infrastructure**

The district has established infrastructure to support restorative practices, though the available content does not identify school-specific positions or programs at Goldsboro Elementary Magnet. At the district level, School Psychologists serve as key implementers of restorative justice principles, working to ""implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as part of their broader mandate to support student mental health and school climate[3]. The district also operates a Positive Behavior Support system with designated MODEL schools that have received training in PBS programming[4]. Professional development is provided to staff throughout the district focusing on ""trauma related issues, mental health"" and related intervention strategies[6].

Additionally, the Seminole County Sheriff's office operates a Prosecution Alternatives for Youth (P.A.Y.) program that includes Teen Court and the Juvenile Alternative Services Program, which promote ""accountability to the victim and the community, through activities such as restitution and community service work""[2]. While this is a juvenile justice program rather than a school-based restorative justice program, it reflects the broader community's commitment to restorative approaches for youth.

**Limitations**

Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine whether Goldsboro Elementary Magnet has dedicated restorative justice staff, specific restorative justice programs, or school-level implementation details. The information provided reflects district-wide policies and approaches rather than school-specific practices.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach, integrated into school psychological services and specific programs as a key strategy for creating safe, positive school climates and promoting positive behavior.[4]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the section ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" alongside efforts to prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, assess school climate, implement school-wide positive behavioral supports, and provide crisis intervention; it is presented as an active practice school psychologists help ""implement and promote.""[4] Related terms like ""restorative practices"" and ""restorative circle"" are mentioned in school improvement plans (SIPs) for specific district schools, such as Journeys Academy, described as a ""Restorative Practices school"" where daily restorative circles build community, empathy, and skills like patience and kindness, supplemented by new Restorative Coaching Sessions requiring students to process incidents and focus on ""restoration and 'making things right'.""[1] Another SIP references professional learning communities on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans.""[5] These mentions occur in official program descriptions and action plans rather than staff listings or mission statements, emphasizing their role in discipline alternatives, behavior management, and social-emotional support.[1][4][5]

This approach aligns with the district's philosophy of fostering positive behavior, mental health, and school connectedness through school psychologists' expertise, where restorative justice is conceptualized as a proactive, school-wide positive discipline method to shift from punitive measures toward community-focused resolution and resilience-building.[4] In alternative programs like Journeys Academy, it forms a core philosophical element, embedding restorative practices into daily routines and individualized coaching to address student needs holistically alongside mental health counseling.[1] Broader district mental health services reinforce this by promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, and peer relationships, with restorative elements supporting tiered interventions and reduced exclusionary discipline.[1][4][6]

Infrastructure includes school psychologists as key implementers who promote restorative justice district-wide, alongside district mental health counselors and school social workers in programs like Journeys Academy's restorative circles, coaching sessions, and small groups.[1][4][6] Professional development initiatives cover restorative practices, such as fidelity checks, reflection logs, and PLCs on trauma-informed care and interventions, with action plans targeting reduced absenteeism and disproportionate discipline via these methods.[1][5] No dedicated coordinators, standalone centers, or school-specific programs at Millennium Middle School are mentioned; implementation appears coordinated through Student Support Services, Intervention Services, and alternative programs under the district's psychological and social work teams.[1][4]

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach, primarily through the promotion of restorative practices as a key component of school psychological services, positive behavioral supports, and school improvement initiatives at Lyman High School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the SCPS district website's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" as one of the responsibilities school psychologists fulfill: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" alongside implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, preventing bullying, and supporting social-emotional learning[5]. Related term ""**Restorative Practices**"" (often used interchangeably in context) is detailed more extensively in Lyman High School's School Improvement Plans (SIPs), such as the 2023-2024 plan, which describes it as a process that ""aims to develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships,"" involving student voice through circles and conferencing, integrated with the Ram Initiative Program for at-risk students and Positive Behavior Supports (PBIS) emphasizing ""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change""[1]. The 2021 SIP further mandates ""Using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" monitored via MTSS team check-ins, teacher documentation in EdInsight, and administrator walkthroughs[1]. These mentions occur in official program descriptions and action plans within SIP PDFs, not as passing references but as structured strategies for behavior management and climate improvement.

This approach reflects a core philosophical integration into SCPS's educational framework, conceptualized as a proactive, relationship-focused alternative to punitive discipline that fosters community, repairs harm, and builds skills like problem-solving, empathy, and resilience. School psychologists promote it to create safe environments strengthening home-school-community ties[5], while Lyman High School embeds it within MTSS and PBIS to reduce inappropriate special education referrals, enhance social-emotional development, and address at-risk behaviors through positive reinforcement and interventions[1]. District-wide, it aligns with Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS), a research-based multi-tiered system reducing problem behaviors and suspensions, with 20 model schools trained in these methods[6].

Infrastructure supporting restorative practices includes school psychologists as key implementers providing counseling, conflict resolution, and referrals[5]; district mental health counselors and school social workers for coordination[9]; and at Lyman High School, a PBIS team, MTSS team for fidelity checks, and the Ram Initiative with faculty advocates[1]. Professional development emphasizes restorative practices, such as classroom fidelity training and trauma-informed PLCs at other SCPS alternative programs like Journeys Academy and Endeavor[2][8]. No dedicated restorative justice coordinators or standalone centers are named, but these roles and initiatives form a clear supportive structure within Student Support Services.

Restorative Justice aligns with the district's philosophy of fostering positive behavior, mental health, and safe learning environments, as conceptualized through school psychologists' expertise in mental health, learning, and behavior to promote problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, resilience, and school connectedness.[3] It is not peripheral but integrated into school-wide practices and policies, complementing efforts like promoting student communication skills, anger management, and referrals to community services.[3] In the SIP, restorative practices support behavioral interventions, rapport-building, and trauma-informed care in alternative settings, indicating a proactive, relationship-focused educational approach rather than punitive measures.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for Restorative Justice, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, centers, or named programs; it falls under general school psychological services with contact at 407.320.0216, and school psychologists collaborate with administrators, teachers, families, counselors, social workers, and community providers.[3] Professional development on restorative practices occurs via PLCs and ongoing training in trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions, but without named initiatives or specialized roles.[5] Alternative programs like Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy and John Polk Alternative School emphasize life skills and mental health but do not reference restorative approaches.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach, particularly within school psychological services and select alternative programs, though it is not mentioned on the Oviedo High School website specifically.**[1][4][6]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the section ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" alongside goals like preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, and providing crisis intervention; it is framed as a key strategy that school psychologists help implement and promote to foster positive discipline.[4] Related concepts like ""restorative practices"" and ""restorative circles"" are detailed in School Improvement Plan (SIP) documents for specific alternative schools, such as Journeys Academy, described as a ""Restorative Practices school"" where daily restorative circles build community, empathy, and skills like patience and kindness, supplemented by new Restorative Coaching Sessions requiring students to process incidents and focus on ""restoration and 'making things right'"" through eight coached sessions.[1] Another SIP for Endeavor school references professional learning communities on ""restorative practices"" alongside trauma-informed care and intervention plans.[6] These mentions occur in official program descriptions and action plans rather than staff listings or mission statements, emphasizing practical implementation for behavior management and discipline reduction.

This integration suggests restorative justice aligns with the district's core philosophy for school psychologists, who partner across stakeholders to create supportive environments by promoting positive behavior, mental health, and positive discipline—conceptualized as shifting from punitive measures to restorative processes that enhance communication, conflict resolution, peer relationships, and school connectedness.[4] In alternative programs like Journeys Academy, it forms a foundational element, evidenced by structured daily circles and coaching to repair harm, engage stakeholders, and prioritize community learning over individual punishment, with monitoring via fidelity checks, reflection logs, and discipline referrals.[1] Broader district mental health supports, including school social workers and counselors, reinforce this by coordinating services that overlap with restorative goals like resilience and social-emotional learning.[7]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed district-wide, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, or standalone Restorative Justice Centers; instead, implementation falls under school psychologists' responsibilities, with targeted programs like Journeys Academy's restorative circles and coaching sessions, and professional development initiatives including training on restorative practices to reduce exclusionary discipline and absenteeism.[1][4][6] Alternative placements like Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy emphasize mental health counseling and life skills but do not explicitly mention restorative elements.[2]

"**Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, including at Milwee Middle School, as evidenced by district-wide psychological services and school-specific improvement plans that integrate restorative practices alongside positive behavioral interventions.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: school psychologists ""implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports (SWPBS), social-emotional learning, and crisis intervention[5]. This positions it within official program descriptions for student support services under Student Support Services. Related term ""**restorative practices**"" (often used interchangeably with restorative justice) features prominently in multiple School Improvement Plans (SIPs), including Milwee Middle School's 2023-2024 SIP, which commits to ""incorporate and continue to implement... **Restorative Practices**"" to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships through student circles and conferencing[1]. Similar integrations occur in other SCPS SIPs, such as commitments to ""using **Restorative Practice** in the classroom with fidelity,"" teacher-led lessons during advisements, and reducing unfavorable school safety survey responses via these practices[1][2][7].

This reflects a core philosophical integration into SCPS's educational approach, particularly for behavior management, mental health, and positive school climate, rather than peripheral mentions. Restorative practices are conceptualized as proactive tools for promoting positive behavior, social skills, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and resilience, often paired with PBIS (""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"") and MTSS frameworks to support at-risk students and reduce special education referrals[1][5]. At Milwee Middle School, they align with strategic goals like Conditions for Learning and the Ram Initiative Program for advocacy[1].

Infrastructure includes school psychologists as dedicated staff who promote restorative justice district-wide[5], PBIS teams for expectation enforcement[1], MTSS teams for check-ins and monitoring fidelity (e.g., classroom walkthroughs, student interviews, EdInsight documentation)[1], and behavior interventionists enhancing PBIS with restorative elements[2]. Ongoing professional development emphasizes restorative practices, trauma-informed care, and behavior intervention plans, with training at school year's start and quarterly MTSS/SST reviews[6][7]. No specific standalone centers or coordinators are named, but these are embedded in psychological services, SIP action plans, and whole-school initiatives.

"Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, explicitly promoted as a component of school psychologists' responsibilities to create safe, positive school climates through the implementation of positive discipline and **restorative justice**[4]. The term appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" alongside efforts to prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, assess school climate, implement school-wide positive behavioral supports, and provide crisis intervention; it is presented as an official programmatic element within school psychologists' roles, which include partnering with families, teachers, administrators, and community providers to foster supportive environments[4]. Related concepts, such as **restorative practices**, emerge in school improvement plans (SIPs) for specific district schools, including Journeys Academy—a designated Restorative Practices school that uses daily restorative circles to build community, empathy, and skills like patience and kindness, alongside new Restorative Coaching Sessions where students process incidents and focus on restoration—and action plans to reduce absenteeism and exclusionary discipline via restorative practices with fidelity checks and reflection logs[1][7].

This integration suggests **Restorative Justice** aligns with the district's broader philosophy of positive behavior intervention supports (PBIS: MTSS), a research-based, multi-tiered system emphasizing positive alternatives to traditional discipline, reducing problem behaviors, and enhancing school climate and academic performance, consistent with federal laws like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act[5]. School psychologists conceptualize it as a tool for promoting positive peer relationships, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and resilience, shifting focus from punishment to community-oriented learning[4]. While not central to mission statements, it is embedded in mental health and behavioral support frameworks, evidenced by professional development on restorative practices, trauma-informed care, and behavioral interventions in SIPs[1][7].

No dedicated infrastructure, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, Restorative Justice centers, or district-wide training programs, is detailed for Red Bug Elementary School itself; however, district-level supports include school psychologists (contact: 407.320.0216) who implement these practices school-wide, 20 model PBIS schools, and targeted programs like Journeys Academy's circles and coaching[1][4][5]. Broader community ties exist via referrals to juvenile justice alternatives incorporating restorative elements, but these are not school-specific[2][3].

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Forest City Elementary School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach to student discipline and behavioral support, though the available content does not provide school-specific details for Forest City Elementary School itself. The district explicitly incorporates **restorative practices** (also referred to as restorative justice) as an official component of its disciplinary framework and educational philosophy.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is listed among core service areas and strategic priorities. Specifically, the district identifies ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a key function of its School Psychological Services department.[5] This placement indicates that restorative justice is not a peripheral mention but rather an integrated component of the district's formal student support infrastructure. The term appears in the context of official district services and strategic initiatives rather than in passing references, suggesting institutional commitment to the approach.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative justice is embedded within SCPS's broader philosophy of positive behavioral intervention and student support. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as part of a comprehensive approach that includes positive behavior supports, social-emotional learning, and trauma-informed care.[5][6] Multiple school improvement plans across SCPS schools reference restorative practices as a method for developing community, managing conflict, and repairing harm through circles and conferencing that give students voice in the disciplinary process.[1] The district's approach aligns with the definition that restorative justice focuses on ""repairing harm done to relationships and people, developing solutions by engaging all persons affected by a harm, and accountability.""[3] This suggests the district views restorative justice not merely as a disciplinary tool but as a foundational philosophy for building positive school communities.

**Infrastructure**

The available content indicates that SCPS has established infrastructure to support restorative practices at the district level, though school-specific infrastructure for Forest City Elementary is not detailed in the provided materials. The district operates a School Psychological Services department that explicitly lists restorative justice implementation as a responsibility.[5] Additionally, multiple schools within SCPS have designated MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) teams that coordinate restorative practices implementation, including teacher training, classroom walkthroughs, and student check-ins documented in the EdInsight system.[1][6] Professional development is provided through Professional Learning Communities that focus on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans.""[6] However, the search results do not identify dedicated restorative justice coordinators, specialized centers, or school-specific programs by name for Forest City Elementary School.

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Idyllwilde Elementary School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide school-specific information for Idyllwilde Elementary School. The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage, indicating it is an established component of the district's student support framework rather than an isolated school initiative.[5]

**Contextual Understanding**

The reference to restorative justice appears on the Seminole County Public Schools' School Psychological Services page, which outlines the roles and responsibilities of school psychologists across the district.[5] In this context, restorative justice is mentioned as one of several approaches that school psychologists implement and promote to create safe, positive school climates. The term appears within a broader list of district priorities that includes positive discipline, school-wide positive behavioral supports, bullying prevention, and social-emotional learning. This positioning suggests that restorative justice is integrated into the district's comprehensive approach to student discipline and school climate rather than presented as a standalone program.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative justice appears to be embedded within the district's philosophy of moving away from traditional punitive discipline models. The School Psychological Services description emphasizes that school psychologists ""implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as part of their work to create supportive learning environments.[5] This framing indicates that restorative justice is conceptualized as an alternative to conventional disciplinary approaches, aligned with the district's commitment to reducing exclusionary practices and promoting community-based problem-solving. The district's broader commitment to this philosophy is evident in other initiatives mentioned in the search results, such as Positive Behavior Support (PBS) systems and restorative practices in schools like Journeys Academy, which suggest a district-wide cultural shift toward restoration and community repair rather than punishment.[2][6]

**Infrastructure**

The search results do not provide specific infrastructure details for Idyllwilde Elementary School. At the district level, the infrastructure supporting restorative approaches includes school psychologists who are trained to implement and promote restorative justice practices.[5] Additionally, the district operates a Multi-Tiered Support System (PBS: MTSS) with 20 designated MODEL schools implementing positive behavior intervention support, and maintains alternative programs such as Journeys Academy, which operates as a dedicated restorative practices school with daily restorative circles and restorative coaching sessions.[2][6] The district also coordinates with external partners, including the Seminole County Prosecution Alternatives for Youth (P.A.Y.) program, which incorporates restorative justice principles through teen court and alternative services that emphasize accountability to victims and community service.[3]

However, the available content does not identify dedicated restorative justice coordinators, specialists, or school-specific programs at Idyllwilde Elementary School, nor does it provide information about training initiatives specific to that school.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, alongside related terms like restorative practices, is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within student support services and school improvement efforts at Eastbrook Elementary School.

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports.""[8] This positions it alongside initiatives like assessing school climate, supporting social-emotional learning, and crisis intervention, indicating its role in fostering positive behavior and connectedness. Relatedly, Eastbrook Elementary's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP) emphasizes ""**Restorative Practices**,"" describing it as a method to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships"" through student circles and conferencing, integrated with Conditions for Learning and PBIS (Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports).[1] The SIP commits to ""Using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" including teacher check-ins, MTSS documentation, and administrative walkthroughs to ensure implementation.[1] Another SCPS SIP references faculty training on ""**restorative practice**"" to foster positive relationships and support behavior intervention plans via MTSS or SST processes.[9]

This integration suggests Restorative Justice forms a core element of the district's philosophy for discipline and mental health support, conceptualized as a proactive, relationship-focused alternative to punitive measures. School psychologists promote it to improve communication, social skills, conflict resolution, and resilience, partnering with teachers, families, and administrators to create supportive environments.[8] At Eastbrook, it aligns with PBIS—using phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change”—and links struggling students to interventions like the Ram Initiative Program, emphasizing voice, accountability, and community repair over exclusionary discipline.[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, Restorative Justice centers, or standalone training programs; instead, it embeds within existing structures like School Psychological Services (contact: 407.320.0216), MTSS teams, PBIS initiatives (with 20 district model schools), and SIP-monitored classroom practices.[1][5][8] Faculty volunteer as advocates, and all students engage in related mental health lessons on self-care and wellness.[1]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Seminole County Public Schools, which oversees Tuslawilla Middle School, explicitly includes restorative justice as part of its approach to creating safe, positive school climates, though it is not presented as a standalone program or dominant framework.

The term ""restorative justice"" appears specifically on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4 and https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section alongside related strategies such as preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, assessing school climate, implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, identifying at-risk students, and providing crisis prevention services[3]. It is framed as an action item for school psychologists: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice,"" indicating its use in the context of school-wide practices to foster positive environments rather than as an official policy document, staff listing, or mission statement[3]. A related term, ""restorative practices,"" emerges in a School Improvement Plan (SIP) document for an alternative program (likely Endeavor, given contextual references), where it is integrated into professional development goals, such as facilitating Professional Learning Communities focused on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans,"" alongside emotional and behavioral supports listed school-wide[5].

This positioning suggests restorative justice aligns with the district's broader philosophy of promoting positive behavior and mental health, as school psychologists are tasked with improving communication skills, problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, and resilience—practices that overlap conceptually with restorative approaches, though not explicitly defined or linked as such[3]. It appears integrated into the educational approach through psychological services and behavioral interventions rather than peripherally, conceptualized as a tool for positive discipline within multi-tiered supports like MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports) and school-wide positive behavioral interventions, emphasizing school connectedness and vulnerability reduction[3][4]. However, the content provides no unique definition or detailed explanation of how restorative justice is operationalized district-wide.

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for restorative justice. There are no mentions of specialized staff positions such as restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists; instead, implementation falls under general roles like school psychologists, who consult on school-wide practices, and school social workers, who handle behavioral needs and interventions[3][4][7]. Programs like alternative placements (e.g., Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy, John Polk Alternative School) focus on life skills, mental health counseling, and remediation without referencing restorative justice[1][8]. Professional development initiatives touch on restorative practices in specific SIP goals for behavioral intervention and trauma-informed care, but no formal training programs, centers, or organizational departments are named exclusively for it[5]. School Psychological Services, contactable at 407.320.0216, represents the closest structural support, partnering across teams for these practices[3].

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Altamonte Elementary School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific information about Altamonte Elementary School's individual implementation of these practices. The term appears in district-level documentation but is not prominently featured in school-specific materials provided in the search results.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the Seminole County Public Schools School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is mentioned as one of several initiatives under the district's commitment to creating safe, positive school climates.[4] Specifically, the district lists ""implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a core function of school psychological services.[4] This positioning indicates that restorative justice is integrated into the district's broader mental health and student support infrastructure rather than existing as an isolated program.

The context suggests that restorative justice is conceptualized as part of a comprehensive approach to discipline and school climate that also includes school-wide positive behavioral supports, bullying prevention, and social-emotional learning.[4] The district frames these practices within the larger mission of school psychological services to help students ""succeed academically, socially, behaviorally, and emotionally.""[4]

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative justice appears to be embedded within Seminole County Public Schools' broader philosophy of positive discipline and mental health support rather than being a standalone initiative. The district's approach emphasizes prevention, intervention, and community-building through multiple mechanisms. While the search results reference restorative practices more extensively in alternative education settings—such as Journeys Academy, which ""begins and ends each school day with a restorative circle"" and implements ""Restorative Coaching Sessions""[1]—the district-level documentation suggests this philosophy extends across the system.

The district conceptualizes restorative justice as complementary to positive behavioral supports and mental health services, all designed to create supportive learning environments and reduce exclusionary discipline practices.[4] This reflects a shift in disciplinary philosophy from punishment-focused approaches to community-oriented, learning-centered interventions.

**Infrastructure**

The search results identify several district-level infrastructure elements related to restorative practices:

School psychologists serve as key personnel implementing these approaches, with the district employing school psychologists, school social workers, and district mental health counselors to provide mental health services.[8] The School Psychological Services department explicitly lists restorative justice implementation among its responsibilities.[4]

At the alternative education level, specific programs demonstrate restorative infrastructure: Journeys Academy operates as a ""Restorative Practices school"" with daily restorative circles and dedicated Restorative Coaching Sessions where students complete eight sessions with a coach to process incidents and discuss restoration.[1] The Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy provides mental health assessments and counseling alongside traditional classroom education.[2]

The district has established an Alternative Programs Department with a Director of Alternative Programs who oversees implementation of restorative and disciplinary procedures across alternative placements.[7] Additionally, the district's Prosecution Alternatives for Youth (P.A.Y.) program, while not exclusively school-based, operates as a restorative alternative to formal court proceedings, promoting ""accountability to the victim and the community, through activities such as restitution and community service work.""[3]

However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists at the individual school level, nor does it detail Altamonte Elementary School's specific infrastructure or staffing related to these practices.

**Conclusion**

Based on the available content, restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district philosophy and is integrated into school psychological services and alternative education programs. However, the search results do not contain sufficient information to determine the specific implementation of restorative justice practices at Altamonte Elementary School itself. The district demonstrates commitment to restorative approaches through its alternative programs and school psychological services framework, but school-level details for Altamonte Elementary are not evident in the provided materials.

"Seminole County Public Schools (SCPS), the district encompassing Woodlands Elementary School, explicitly includes **restorative justice** as part of its approach to creating safe, positive school climates, though it appears as one element within a broader framework of psychological and behavioral supports rather than a standalone program.[3] The term is mentioned once on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed alongside other strategies under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" in the context of school psychologists' roles in preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, assessing school climate, implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, and providing crisis intervention.[3] This is not framed within official policies, mission statements, or staff listings but as a descriptive bullet point in a program overview highlighting psychologists' contributions to school-wide practices.

This mention suggests **restorative justice** aligns peripherally with the district's philosophy of promoting positive behavior and mental health, which emphasizes problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, and positive discipline as alternatives to traditional methods.[3][4] School psychologists are positioned to ""implement and promote"" it as part of fostering school connectedness and reducing violence, integrating it conceptually with evidence-based practices like Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS: MTSS), a multi-tiered system trained across all SCPS schools to reduce problem behaviors and suspensions.[4] However, the content does not define restorative justice explicitly or detail its conceptualization beyond this promotion, indicating it is not a core, deeply integrated pillar but one tool among many, such as individual counseling, anger management, and referrals to community services.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure for restorative justice is evident in the available content. There are no mentions of specialized staff positions (e.g., restorative justice coordinators or facilitators), named programs or centers, training initiatives specifically for restorative justice, or distinct organizational structures.[3][4][5] Instead, implementation falls under general school psychological services, with psychologists partnering across teams, and broader supports like PBIS training for all district school staff or alternative placements for at-risk students (e.g., Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy).[1][4] A single reference to ""restorative practices"" appears in a school improvement plan PDF for an unspecified SCPS school (Endeavor), within professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care and intervention plans, but this is not linked to Woodlands Elementary or district-wide restorative justice efforts.[6]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, referred to interchangeably as restorative practices or restorative justice in district materials, is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within student support services and school improvement initiatives at schools like Lake Mary Elementary.[1][5][7]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: school psychologists ""implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports (PBIS), assessing school climate, and supporting social-emotional learning.[5] Related term ""restorative practices"" features prominently in multiple School Improvement Plans (SIPs) for SCPS schools, including Lake Mary Elementary's 2023-2024 SIP, where it is described as a method to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships,"" involving student circles and conferencing.[1] Other SIPs detail its use in classrooms with fidelity, such as teachers holding check-ins, administrators conducting walkthroughs to verify implementation, and integration with PBIS lessons to reduce aggression, confrontations, and fighting incidents.[1][7][8] These mentions occur in official program descriptions for psychological services and actionable SIP strategies, not as passing references or staff listings.

This approach aligns with SCPS's broader philosophy of fostering positive behavior, mental health, and school connectedness, where restorative practices are integrated into multi-tiered systems of support (MTSS), behavior intervention plans (BIPs), and trauma-informed care, conceptualized as non-punitive tools for repairing harm, building relationships, and promoting accountability through student voice and positive reinforcement phrases like ""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change.""[1][5][6] It supports diverse learners and reduces inappropriate special education referrals by emphasizing communication, social skills, conflict resolution, and resilience, positioning it centrally in the district's educational framework rather than peripherally.[5]

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, restorative justice centers, or standalone training programs; instead, implementation relies on existing roles like school psychologists, MTSS teams, administrators, and PBIS teams, with professional development embedded in SIP action plans (e.g., training on restorative practices at the school year's start and ongoing PLCs focused on trauma-informed care and restorative practices).[1][6][7] Faculty volunteer through initiatives like the Ram Initiative Program for at-risk students, and practices are monitored via tools like EdInsight for check-ins and classroom observations.[1]

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Sterling Park Elementary School / Seminole County

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific information about Sterling Park Elementary School's individual implementation of these practices. The term appears in district-level documentation related to school psychological services and school climate initiatives, indicating that restorative justice is an established component of the district's broader educational philosophy.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is mentioned as part of the district's commitment to creating safe, positive school climates[4]. Specifically, restorative justice is listed among the strategies that school psychologists implement and promote to ""prevent bullying and other forms of violence"" and to support ""social-emotional learning""[4]. The reference appears within an official description of district services and staff responsibilities, indicating that restorative justice is integrated into formal district policy and practice rather than mentioned peripherally.

Additionally, the Seminole Resilient Community Project, funded by the Consortium of Florida Education Foundations, emphasizes ""restorative practices"" as a key component of professional development for teachers, parents, caregivers, and community members[3]. This initiative, which included workshops and youth summits, demonstrates that restorative approaches are actively promoted across the district's schools.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative justice appears to be integrated into Seminole County Public Schools' educational philosophy as part of a comprehensive approach to student support and school climate. The district conceptualizes restorative justice within a broader framework that includes positive discipline, positive behavioral supports, conflict resolution, and social-emotional learning[4]. Rather than viewing restorative justice as a standalone program, the district positions it as one element of a multi-layered system designed to promote positive behavior, mental health, and safe learning environments. The emphasis on ""restorative practices"" in professional development initiatives suggests that the district views this approach as foundational to how staff should interact with students and manage behavioral concerns.

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not identify dedicated restorative justice coordinators, specialists, or centers specific to Sterling Park Elementary School or the district as a whole. However, the district has established infrastructure that supports restorative approaches: School Psychologists serve as key implementers of restorative justice practices, working with school administrators to improve school-wide practices and policies[4]. The Seminole Resilient Community Project represents a district-level initiative that provided professional development in restorative practices to over forty-five workshops for educators and community members, with more than 1,100 participants directly impacted[3]. Additionally, the district's School Psychological Services department, which can be contacted at 407.320.0216, oversees the implementation of these practices across schools[4].

The content does not provide sufficient detail to determine whether Sterling Park Elementary School has a dedicated restorative justice program, specific staff positions focused on restorative practices, or a dedicated center or space for restorative work.

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, primarily promoted through school psychological services as a component of creating safe, positive school climates, though it lacks detailed implementation specifics or dedicated infrastructure at Sabal Point Elementary School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section alongside related practices such as preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, assessing school climate, implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, and providing crisis intervention[4]. It is presented as an active strategy school psychologists ""implement and promote,"" paired with positive discipline, but without elaboration on methods, training, or outcomes. Related concepts like ""restorative practices"" emerge in district school improvement plans (SIPs), such as a 2021 document referencing ""School-Wide Emotional and Behavioral Restorative Practices"" as a goal with allocated resources (2 staff, 50% time) and professional development on trauma-informed care and restorative practices[7], and a 2024 SCPS Consequence Unit SIP mentioning restorative practices in contexts like school events, mentoring, and counseling opportunities[8]. These mentions occur in official program descriptions and planning documents, not mission statements or staff listings, indicating intentional but peripheral integration rather than core policy.

This positioning suggests restorative justice aligns with SCPS's broader philosophy of positive behavior interventions and mental health support, conceptualized as a tool for fostering positive school environments, emotional/behavioral needs assessment, conflict resolution, and resilience-building by school psychologists who partner across stakeholders[4]. It complements district-wide initiatives like Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS), a research-based multi-tiered system reducing problem behaviors and suspensions through positive alternatives[5], and services for diverse learners or at-risk students[4][6]. However, it appears more philosophical than deeply embedded, as no unique definition or school-specific application is provided, and it coexists with traditional disciplinary elements like alternative placements (e.g., Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy, John Polk Alternative School)[1].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for restorative justice. School psychologists handle promotion and implementation without specified coordinators, facilitators, or specialists[4]; there are no named programs, centers, restorative justice training initiatives, or organizational departments beyond general psychological and intervention services[6][9]. Professional development touches on restorative practices in SIPs (e.g., PLCs on trauma-informed care and interventions)[7], but lacks details on scope or providers. Alternative programs focus on juvenile justice transitions or consequences, not restorative elements[1][8].

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, primarily through the integration of restorative practices and positive discipline strategies, though it is not presented as a standalone program at Rainbow Elementary School specifically.** The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page, listed among key responsibilities such as implementing and promoting positive discipline and restorative justice, alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports, assessing school climate, and supporting social-emotional learning[6]. Related terms like ""restorative practices"" or ""restorative practice"" are more frequently mentioned in school improvement plans (SIPs) across the district, including those for elementary schools, where they are described as tools to develop community, manage conflict by repairing harm and restoring relationships, and give students a voice through circles and conferencing[1]. For instance, one SIP commits to using restorative practice in classrooms with fidelity, involving check-ins, documentation in EdInsight, and administrative walkthroughs[1], while others outline teacher training on implementation to foster positive environments and reduce unfavorable responses on school safety surveys[3][8].

This approach aligns with SCPS's broader philosophy of positive behavior interventions, as seen in the district's Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS) framework, which emphasizes research-based alternatives to traditional discipline to reduce problem behaviors, improve climate, and boost academic performance[4]. Restorative practices are conceptualized as integral to promoting positive behavior and mental health, enhancing communication, social skills, problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, and peer relationships, often in tandem with PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports), trauma-informed care, and MTSS[1][2][6][7]. They appear embedded in official program descriptions and action plans within SIPs and district services, rather than as peripheral mentions, indicating philosophical integration into student support, behavior management, and school connectedness[1][3][6].

Infrastructure supporting these practices includes district-wide training for staff on PBS and related methods, with school psychologists tasked with direct implementation of restorative justice and positive supports[4][6]. School-specific SIPs reference faculty training on restorative practices, behavior interventionists enhancing PBIS, MTSS teams for monitoring, and professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care and restorative practices[1][3][7][8]. No dedicated staff positions like restorative justice coordinators or specialized centers are named exclusively for Rainbow Elementary, and the school's own website lacks any mentions; however, district resources such as school psychological services (contact: 407.320.0216) and model PBS schools provide systemic backing[4][6]. While not deeply detailed for Rainbow Elementary, the district's emphasis suggests availability through shared supports.

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly through the district's School Psychological Services and integrated into school improvement plans (SIPs) across multiple schools, including those under the district serving Lake Orienta Elementary School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key practice that school psychologists ""implement and promote"" alongside positive discipline and school-wide positive behavioral supports (PBIS) to foster safe learning environments, support social-emotional learning, assess school climate, and identify at-risk students[5]. Related term ""restorative practices"" (often used interchangeably with restorative justice in district documents) is mentioned more extensively in SIPs for the 2023-2024 school year, such as Lake Orienta Elementary's plan, which commits to ""incorporate and continue to implement... Restorative Practices"" to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships via circles and conferencing, alongside PBIS and the Ram Initiative Program for at-risk students[1]. Similar integrations appear in other SCPS SIPs, including actions like ""using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" teacher-led lessons during advisories, and reducing discipline incidents through restorative models to improve school safety survey responses[2][8]. These references frame restorative practices as official strategies within MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), behavior intervention plans (BIPs), and positive behavior frameworks, rather than peripheral mentions[1][7].

This approach reflects a core philosophical commitment in SCPS to non-punitive, relationship-focused discipline that promotes positive behavior, mental health, resilience, social skills, conflict resolution, and equity in discipline, aligning with district goals to reduce special education referrals, support diverse learners, and strengthen family-school partnerships[5]. Restorative justice/practices are conceptualized as tools for repairing harm, giving students a voice, reinforcing coping skills, and addressing emotional/behavioral needs, integrated with PBIS phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change” to emphasize positive choices over exclusionary measures[1][5].

Infrastructure supporting this includes school psychologists who deliver direct interventions, counseling, and coordination with PBIS teams, MTSS/SST processes for behavior progress monitoring, and professional development on restorative practices, trauma-informed care, classroom management, and BIPs[1][5][6][7]. Specific implementations involve classroom walkthroughs, check-ins documented in EdInsight, faculty training (e.g., annually at the start of the year), volunteer advocates via programs like Ram Initiative, and behavior interventionists enhancing PBIS[1][2][7]. No dedicated standalone positions like ""restorative justice coordinators"" or centers are named exclusively for Lake Orienta Elementary, but district-wide structures embed these practices within psychological services, MTSS teams, and SIP action plans overseen by administrators and staff[1][5].

This integration suggests Restorative Justice aligns with the district's philosophy of promoting positive behavior and mental health, conceptualized as a proactive discipline method to enhance school connectedness and reduce violence, working in tandem with counseling, problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, and resilience-building.[4] It appears thoughtfully woven into the educational approach through school-wide practices led by psychologists, who partner with teachers, administrators, families, and community providers to individualize interventions and monitor progress.[4] However, the content does not elaborate on a unique district definition or detailed implementation guidelines, framing it instead as one tool among many for behavioral and emotional support.[4][7] Related concepts like **restorative practices** emerge peripherally in a School Improvement Plan (SIP) document, where professional learning communities are facilitated to focus on ""trauma informed care, **restorative practices**, and the effectiveness of intervention plans,"" indicating some training-level integration at individual schools, though not tied directly to Lake Brantley High School.[6]

No dedicated infrastructure for Restorative Justice is evident in the available content, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, centers, or named programs; it relies instead on existing roles like school psychologists, who handle its promotion alongside broader duties, and general mental health staff including social workers and counselors.[4][5][7] Alternative programs like Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy and John Polk Alternative School emphasize life skills, counseling, and remediation for at-risk or justice-involved students but do not reference restorative approaches.[1][8] District-wide mental health supports, including a tiered continuum and resiliency education, provide contextual backing through social-emotional learning but lack explicit restorative justice infrastructure.[7] Overall, while present in the district's psychological services framework, the approach lacks detailed evidence of robust, school-specific implementation at Lake Brantley High School, with terms found only on district pages.

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) district-wide approach, particularly within school psychological services and select school programs, though it is not explicitly tied to Hamilton Elementary School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears specifically on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the goal of ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" alongside actions like implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, preventing bullying, and identifying at-risk students[4]. It is presented as a promoted practice by school psychologists to foster safe environments, without further definition or examples. Related term ""restorative practices"" (often used interchangeably) occurs more extensively in district School Improvement Plans (SIPs), such as at Lake Mary High School, where it involves classroom implementation with fidelity, circles, conferencing to repair harm and restore relationships, and integration with MTSS for at-risk students[1]; Journeys Academy, a district alternative program designated as a Restorative Practices school with daily restorative circles, coaching sessions focused on restoration and ""making things right,"" and small groups with mental health counselors[2]; and Endeavor school, where it features in professional development on trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions[6]. These mentions are embedded in official program descriptions and action plans rather than mission statements or staff listings, emphasizing practical strategies for behavior management, social-emotional learning, and reducing exclusionary discipline.

This approach reflects a philosophical commitment to positive, relational discipline over punitive measures, integrated into SCPS's broader educational framework supporting mental health, positive behavior, and diverse learners via school psychologists who consult on school-wide policies[4]. Restorative justice/practices are conceptualized as tools for promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, resilience, and community-building, often linked to initiatives like Positive Behavior Supports (PBIS), Ram Advocate check-ins, and MTSS to address root causes of behavioral issues rather than isolated punishment[1][2][4].

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for Hamilton Elementary specifically, but district-wide elements include school psychologists tasked with promoting restorative justice and positive discipline[4]; alternative programs like Journeys Academy with structured restorative circles and coaching[2]; professional development on restorative practices in PLCs and for behavioral interventions[1][6]; and integration into MTSS teams for fidelity checks and student support[1].

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, primarily through district-wide student support services and school-specific initiatives like restorative practices, though it is not presented as a standalone centerpiece but integrated into broader behavioral and mental health frameworks.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the SCPS district website's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports, bullying prevention, and crisis intervention[5]. This positions it within official program descriptions for school psychologists, who partner with families, teachers, and administrators to foster supportive environments. Related term ""restorative practices"" (often used interchangeably in context) emerges more prominently in Crooms Academy's School Improvement Plan (SIP) for 2023-2024 (https://sim.scps.k12.fl.us/content/pdf/schools/information/sip/2023/0071.pdf), described as ""Restorative Practices, which aims to develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships. This process works with students to give them a voice through use of circles and conferencing""[1]. The SIP commits to ""Using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" with monitoring via teacher check-ins, administrator walkthroughs, and MTSS team documentation. Similar mentions appear in other SCPS SIPs, such as professional development on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices"" at another school[8] and references to restorative practices in alternative program contexts[9]. These are not passing mentions but embedded in actionable school plans and district service outlines, distinct from external programs like Seminole Sheriff's P.A.Y. or judicial alternatives[2][3].

This reflects a district philosophy emphasizing positive, relational discipline over punitive measures, aligning restorative justice/practices with goals like promoting positive behavior, mental health, conflict resolution, and resilience—core to school psychologists' roles in assessing emotional needs, providing counseling, and reinforcing coping skills[5]. At Crooms Academy, it integrates into a multi-tiered system including Positive Behavior Supports (PBIS: MTSS), Ram Initiative advocacy, and mental health lessons, using phrases like “Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change” to emphasize positive choices and link struggling students to interventions[1]. District-wide, it supports PBS: MTSS as a research-based alternative to suspensions/expulsions, with 20 model schools trained in positive interventions[6]. Conceptualized as repairing harm, restoring relationships, and empowering student voice via circles and conferencing, it connects to broader SCPS aims of academic achievement, diverse learner support, and family partnerships[5][7].

Infrastructure includes school psychologists as key implementers across SCPS, with no dedicated restorative justice coordinators named but clear roles for them in promotion and delivery[5]. Crooms Academy's PBIS team and MTSS team oversee fidelity through check-ins (EdInsight documentation), walkthroughs, and trusted adult identification[1]. Professional development focuses on restorative practices, trauma-informed care, and behavioral interventions, with PLCs and PD sign-ins tracking progress[1][8]. Alternative programs reference restorative elements (e.g., SCPS Consequence Unit mentions restorative practices alongside juvenile justice transitions)[9], and district initiatives like Families in Need and psychological services provide supportive structures[7]. No standalone centers or specialists are detailed, but integration into existing teams like PBIS and MTSS indicates operational embedding rather than siloed infrastructure.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' approach, as stated in the district's School Psychological Services description, where school psychologists are tasked with implementing and promoting it alongside positive discipline and school-wide positive behavioral supports to create safe, positive school climates.[4]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears solely on the district website's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), within the section on **Create Safe, Positive School Climates**. It is listed as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice,"" positioned after preventing bullying and supporting social-emotional learning, and before identifying at-risk students. This positions it as an official component of school psychologists' roles in fostering school connectedness and crisis prevention, rather than a passing mention or isolated policy. No occurrences appear on the Heathrow Elementary School website itself.[4]

Restorative Justice forms part of the district's educational philosophy, integrated into the broader framework of mental health, behavior management, and positive school environments promoted by school psychologists. It is conceptualized as a proactive strategy to enhance student emotional and behavioral needs through problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, and resilience-building, aligning with goals like reducing violence, improving school climate, and supporting diverse learners. This integration connects to related district initiatives, such as Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS), a research-based multi-tiered system that provides positive alternatives to traditional discipline, implemented across schools including 20 model PBS sites.[5] External references, like a 2024 presentation on Trauma/Restorative Informed Coaching (T/RIC) used in Seminole County Schools, further indicate its role in building resiliency and improving culture/climate metrics in the ""5 Essentials Survey.""[1]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for Restorative Justice. The content does not mention specific staff positions like coordinators or facilitators, nor programs such as Restorative Justice Centers, training initiatives, or organizational departments solely for it. Instead, implementation falls under general school psychologist roles (contact: 407.320.0216), who consult on school-wide practices, and aligns with PBS: MTSS teams involving families and professionals. School Improvement Plans reference related professional development on restorative practices and trauma-informed care in PLCs, but without dedicated structures.[7]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice, often referenced interchangeably with **Restorative Practices**, is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, integrated into district-wide student support services and school-level improvement plans for schools like Keeth Elementary.

The term ""restorative justice"" appears directly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports and social-emotional learning initiatives[1][6]. Related term ""**Restorative Practices**"" features prominently in Keeth Elementary's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP), where the school commits to ""incorporate and continue to implement... **Restorative Practices**"" to develop community, manage conflict, repair harm, and restore relationships through student circles and conferencing[1]. Another SCPS school SIP similarly emphasizes faculty training on ""**restorative practice**"" implementation to foster positive behavior via MTSS processes[7]. These mentions occur in official program descriptions and strategic plans, not as passing references, framing restorative approaches as core to discipline alternatives within Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS/MTSS)[3].

This integration reflects a district philosophy prioritizing positive, non-exclusionary discipline over traditional suspensions, with school psychologists tasked to ""promote positive behavior and mental health"" through conflict resolution, social skills, and resilience-building—explicitly linking to restorative methods[6]. At Keeth, it aligns with PBIS (""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"") and MTSS interventions, positioning restorative practices as a tool for academic achievement, behavior management, and equity in diverse learner support[1][6]. The district conceptualizes it as repairing relationships and empowering student voice, consistent with broader definitions of non-punitive responses that reduce special education referrals and enhance school climate[3][4].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, Restorative Justice centers, or standalone training programs; instead, implementation relies on existing structures like school psychologists, MTSS teams, PBIS-trained staff across all schools (with 20 model sites), and volunteer faculty advocates via Keeth's Ram Initiative[1][3][6]. Fidelity measures at Keeth include classroom walkthroughs, student interviews, teacher check-ins via EdInsight, and trusted adult surveys, indicating embedded but generalized support rather than specialized roles[1].

For example, the full phrase reads: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice,"" directly linking it to broader efforts in crisis prevention and school connectedness.[4]

This inclusion suggests Restorative Justice forms part of the district's philosophy for fostering positive behavior and mental health, conceptualized as a proactive strategy to enhance school climate, reduce violence, and support emotional needs through psychologist-led interventions. It aligns with related emphases on promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, resilience, and positive behavioral interventions, as outlined in the same page's sections on promoting positive behavior and supporting diverse learners.[4] However, it is not deeply elaborated, appearing more as one element in a multi-tiered support system that prioritizes psychological expertise over punitive measures, consistent with district-wide Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS) initiatives that reduce problem behaviors and suspensions.[5]

Similar integrations occur in other SCPS SIPs, including plans emphasizing classroom implementation with fidelity, teacher-led lessons during advisories, and use in conflict resolution to reduce aggression and referrals[5][8][9].

This reflects integration into the district's educational philosophy, where restorative justice/practices support positive behavior interventions, mental health promotion, and trauma-informed care, conceptualized as non-punitive methods to repair relationships, build resilience, and coordinate with PBIS and MTSS frameworks[1][6][7]. School psychologists promote it district-wide to foster safe environments and positive coping skills[6], while SIPs tie it to goals like reducing incidents through student voice and positive reinforcement[1][9], indicating a core component of behavior management rather than peripheral mention.

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Winter Springs High School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach, though the available content does not provide specific information about Winter Springs High School's individual implementation of these practices. The district explicitly identifies restorative justice as a component of its school psychological services framework.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the Seminole County Public Schools School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is mentioned as one of several strategies that school psychological services implement to create safe, positive school climates.[5] Specifically, the district lists ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a core function within the broader category of creating safe, positive school environments.[5] This positioning indicates that restorative justice is integrated into the district's official service delivery model rather than presented as a peripheral initiative.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative justice appears to be embedded within Seminole County Public Schools' broader philosophy of positive behavioral intervention and support. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as part of a comprehensive approach to discipline that emphasizes prevention, community building, and positive behavior support rather than punitive measures.[5][6] The Positive Behavior Support: A Multi-Tiered Support System (PBS: MTSS) framework explicitly describes itself as ""a positive and effective alternative to the traditional methods of discipline"" and is ""research-based and proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of problem behaviors in the school, resulting in a more positive school climate and increased academic performance.""[6] This suggests that restorative justice functions as a foundational element within the district's larger commitment to evidence-based, preventative discipline strategies.

**Infrastructure**

The search results indicate that Seminole County Public Schools has established infrastructure to support restorative practices across the district. School psychologists serve as key personnel who help implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice at the school level.[5] The district has designated 20 schools as MODEL schools through the Positive Behavior Intervention Support program, suggesting a structured, district-wide implementation framework.[6] Additionally, the district operates specialized programs such as Journeys Academy, which is explicitly identified as a ""Restorative Practices school"" that begins and ends each school day with restorative circles designed to build community and develop student empathy, patience, kindness, courage, and open-mindedness.[1] Journeys Academy also implements Restorative Coaching Sessions, in which each student completes eight sessions with a coach to process incidents and discuss restoration and ""making things right.""[1] Professional development is provided throughout the district, with focus areas including trauma-informed care and restorative practices.[8]

However, the available content does not provide specific information about dedicated restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialists at Winter Springs High School, nor does it detail whether Winter Springs High School operates any school-specific restorative justice programs or centers.

This positions it within mental health and behavioral support services provided by school psychologists, who partner with families, teachers, and administrators to foster safe learning environments. Relatedly, ""Restorative Practices"" (often used interchangeably with restorative justice) is prominently featured in Greenwood Lakes Middle School's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP), where the school commits to ""incorporate and continue to implement... **Restorative Practices**"" as part of Conditions for Learning and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS)[1]. The SIP defines it as a process to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships,"" involving student voice through circles and conferencing, with fidelity monitored via classroom check-ins, administrator walkthroughs, and MTSS team documentation[1].

This integration suggests restorative justice and practices form a core element of the district's philosophy for promoting positive behavior, mental health, and conflict resolution, rather than peripheral mentions. School psychologists conceptualize it as a proactive strategy to improve communication, social skills, problem-solving, anger management, and peer relationships, complementing PBIS initiatives like ""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"" at Greenwood Lakes[1][5]. At the school level, it aligns with broader goals to reduce special education referrals, support at-risk students via the Ram Initiative Program, and link struggling students to interventions, indicating a philosophical emphasis on repairing harm over punitive measures[1].

No dedicated infrastructure is explicitly described, such as specialized restorative justice coordinators, centers, or training programs; instead, implementation relies on existing roles like school psychologists, PBIS teams, MTSS teams, and general faculty who volunteer as advocates[1][5]. Classroom-level application is emphasized, with action steps like teachers using restorative practices with fidelity and administrators verifying through student interviews[1]. District-wide, it ties into psychological services and alternative placements like the Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy, but without named restorative-specific structures[3].

This positioning indicates that Restorative Justice forms part of the district's core philosophy for fostering positive behavior and mental health, conceptualized as a proactive, school-wide practice to enhance connectedness, reduce vulnerabilities, and support emotional needs, rather than a peripheral mention.[3] School psychologists apply it through collaborations with administrators to improve policies, alongside interventions like counseling, problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, and positive peer relationships.[3] The related restorative practices in the SIP further embed it into behavioral interventions, trauma-informed care, and classroom management training, connecting philosophy to staff development for consistent implementation.[5]

There are no mentions of specialized staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), organizational departments, or specific training initiatives beyond general professional development on restorative practices.[3][5] School Psychological Services relies on psychologists who promote it as one of many tools, supported by school social workers and counselors, but without distinct structures.[3][4][7] Alternative programs like John Polk Alternative School focus on remediation and life skills for justice-involved students, without referencing restorative approaches.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' approach, particularly through district-wide psychological services and school-specific improvement plans at Bentley Elementary School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed as a key responsibility: school psychologists ""implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**,"" alongside school-wide positive behavioral supports, assessing school climate, and supporting social-emotional learning[7]. Relatedly, Bentley Elementary's 2023-2024 School Improvement Plan (SIP) emphasizes ""**Restorative Practices**,"" describing them as a method to ""develop community and to manage conflict and tensions by repairing harm and restoring relationships"" via student circles and conferencing, integrated with PBIS (Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports), Conditions for Learning, and the Ram Initiative Program for at-risk students[1]. The SIP commits to ""using Restorative Practice in the classroom with fidelity,"" monitored through MTSS team check-ins, teacher documentation in EdInsight, and administrative walkthroughs[1]. An earlier 2021 SIP for another Seminole school references professional development on ""**restorative practices**"" within trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions[8]. These mentions occur in official program descriptions and action plans rather than mission statements or staff listings, framing restorative approaches as proactive tools for behavior management, relationship repair, and positive school climate.

This indicates restorative justice and practices form part of the district's philosophy, conceptualized as complementary to positive discipline, PBIS, and mental health supports to foster academic achievement, positive behavior, resilience, and social skills—core roles of school psychologists who partner across stakeholders for supportive environments[7][1]. At Bentley Elementary, it is integrated into the educational approach via SIP goals emphasizing community-building and conflict resolution, not merely peripheral, as implementation is tracked with fidelity measures and linked to interventions like mental health lessons and positive reinforcement phrases (""Be Respectful, Be Responsible, Be Engaged, and Be the Change"")[1].

No dedicated infrastructure is detailed, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, centers, or training programs named exclusively for restorative justice; instead, it falls under school psychologists (contact: 407.320.0216), MTSS teams, PBIS teams, and general professional development on behavioral best practices[7][1][8].

The term ""restorative justice"" is listed as appearing on this single district page under School Psychological Services, which describes school psychologists' contributions to academic achievement, positive behavior, mental health, and support for diverse learners through assessments, counseling, behavior management, and family partnerships. Examples include promoting ""problem-solving, anger management, and conflict resolution,"" reinforcing ""positive coping skills and resilience,"" and improving ""communication and social skills,"" but these are framed as general psychological interventions rather than restorative justice frameworks. There are no mentions in official policies, program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements; the reference is a passing or erroneous tag without substantive context or examples tying it to district practices.[1]

This absence indicates that restorative justice does not form part of the school or district's explicitly stated philosophy. The page emphasizes a supportive, intervention-based educational approach centered on mental health expertise, MTSS (Multi-Tiered System of Supports), and collaboration to foster safe learning environments, but it conceptualizes behavior and conflict management through psychological tools like individual/group counseling and data-driven strategies, not restorative principles such as harm repair via circles or conferencing. Without integration into core descriptions, it remains peripheral or nonexistent in the available content.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within School Psychological Services, though it is not presented as a standalone program or central philosophy specific to Partin Elementary School.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the section ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates."" It is mentioned alongside related initiatives as one of the responsibilities of school psychologists: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**. Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports."" This positions it as a proactive strategy for fostering safe environments, preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, and addressing at-risk students, rather than as an official policy, staff role, or mission statement element. No mentions occur on Partin Elementary School's own website; all findings are district-level.[3]

This inclusion suggests restorative justice aligns with the district's broader philosophy of promoting positive behavior and mental health, integrated into school psychologists' roles alongside practices like problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive coping skills, and school-wide positive behavioral supports. School psychologists are described as partnering with families, teachers, and administrators to create supportive learning environments, with restorative justice conceptualized as a tool for positive discipline and climate improvement, not punitive measures. However, it appears more as a promoted intervention than a deeply embedded or defined core philosophy, lacking detailed explanation of its meaning or application specific to Partin Elementary.[3]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for restorative justice. There are no mentions of specialized staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures solely for it. Instead, it falls under general School Psychological Services, delivered by school psychologists who provide counseling, assessments, and school-wide supports.

"# Restorative Justice Approach at Rock Lake Middle School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice (referred to as ""restorative practices"" and ""restorative justice"" interchangeably) is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach to student discipline and behavioral support[5]. However, the available content does not provide school-specific information about Rock Lake Middle School's individual implementation of these practices.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the Seminole County Public Schools' School Psychological Services webpage[5], which serves as a district-level resource page rather than a school-specific document. On this page, restorative justice is mentioned as one of several core functions of the district's school psychological services division. Specifically, the district lists ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a primary service objective, positioning it alongside other initiatives such as school-wide positive behavioral supports, social-emotional learning support, and crisis prevention services[5]. The mention appears in an official service description rather than as a passing reference, suggesting it is an intentional component of the district's psychological and behavioral support framework.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the district-level content available, restorative justice appears to be integrated into Seminole County Public Schools' broader philosophy of student support and positive discipline. The district conceptualizes restorative practices as a non-punitive disciplinary approach focused on repairing harm, developing solutions through engagement of affected parties, and promoting accountability[3]. The district's positioning of restorative justice alongside mental health support, social-emotional learning, and positive behavioral interventions suggests these practices are viewed as part of a comprehensive, proactive approach to school climate and student success rather than as a standalone disciplinary tool. However, the specific philosophy and implementation approach at Rock Lake Middle School cannot be determined from the available content.

**Infrastructure**

The search results do not provide information about dedicated staff positions, specific programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures at Rock Lake Middle School related to restorative justice. While the district-level content indicates that restorative practices are promoted through school psychological services and mentions professional development focused on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans""[6], no school-specific infrastructure details are available for Rock Lake Middle School.

"# Restorative Justice Approach in Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative Justice is an established and integrated component of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) disciplinary and behavioral support philosophy. The district explicitly incorporates restorative practices as a core element of its approach to school discipline and student behavior management, moving away from traditional punitive methods toward community-focused accountability and repair.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services webpage (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is presented as part of the district's broader commitment to creating safe, positive school climates[4]. The reference appears within the context of official district services and strategic priorities rather than as a peripheral mention. Specifically, restorative justice is listed among the key functions that school psychologists perform to ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" positioning it as a foundational element of the district's student support infrastructure[4].

Beyond this primary reference, restorative practices are extensively documented across multiple SCPS documents and programs. Journeys Academy, a district alternative school, operates as a ""Restorative Practices school"" that begins and ends each school day with restorative circles designed to build community and develop student empathy, patience, kindness, courage, and open-mindedness[1]. The district also implements restorative practices at the secondary level through its Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Multi-Tiered Support System, which provides ""a positive and effective alternative to the traditional methods of discipline"" and is described as ""research-based and proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of problem behaviors in the school""[5]. Additionally, the Eighteenth Judicial Circuit's Alternative Consequences Component Matrix references ""Community Restorative Justice"" as a specific sanction option for juvenile offenders in Seminole County[3].

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative Justice represents a fundamental philosophical shift within SCPS from punishment-centered discipline to learning-centered, community-focused accountability. The district's approach emphasizes repairing harm through inclusive processes that engage all stakeholders, with a documented focus on ""shifting the focus of discipline from punishment to learning and from the individual to the community""[1]. This philosophy is not peripheral but rather integrated into the district's official student support services, alternative programs, and behavioral intervention strategies.

The district conceptualizes restorative practices as mechanisms for building community relationships, developing student competencies, and addressing root causes of behavioral issues. At Journeys Academy, for example, students complete eight Restorative Coaching Sessions to ""process the incident(s) which resulted in their administrative assignment"" and discuss ""restoration and 'making things right'""[1]. This reflects a philosophy centered on accountability, personal growth, and community healing rather than exclusionary discipline.

**Infrastructure**

SCPS has developed substantial infrastructure to support restorative justice implementation:

*Dedicated Programs and Facilities:* Journeys Academy operates as a district restorative practices school with structured restorative circles and coaching sessions[1]. The district also supports the Seminole County Prosecution Alternatives for Youth (P.A.Y.) program, which includes Teen Court and the Juvenile Alternative Services Program as alternatives to formal court proceedings, promoting ""accountability to the victim and the community, through activities such as restitution and community service work""[2].

*Staff and Positions:* School psychologists, school social workers, and district mental health counselors provide direct support for restorative approaches[7]. Journeys Academy employs restorative coaches who conduct individual sessions with students[1]. The P.A.Y. program is staffed with eight full-time staff members and over 25 volunteers, including trained Volunteer Hearing Officers who complete specialized training in juvenile justice procedures, communication, conflict resolution, and sanction philosophy[2].

*Training and Professional Development:* The district provides professional development focused on restorative practices. Documentation indicates that staff receive training on ""trauma related issues, mental health,"" and ""developing a common language for intervention""[6]. Professional Learning Communities (PLCs) specifically focus on ""trauma informed care, restorative practices, and the effectiveness of intervention plans""[6].

*Organizational Structure:* The district's School Psychological Services department explicitly lists the implementation and promotion of ""positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a core function[4]. The Department of Alternative Programs utilizes ""school, home and community collaboration"" to support student achievement[9]. Additionally, 20 SCPS",[restorative justice @ https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4 (district)]: sess school climate and improve school connectedness.

No occurrences appear on the Layer Elementary School website; all findings are from district pages.[4][5]

This inclusion positions Restorative Justice as integrated into the district's educational philosophy, particularly within mental health and behavioral support frameworks led by school psychologists, who partner with families, teachers, administrators, and community providers to foster safe learning environments.[4] It is conceptualized as a proactive strategy for school-wide practices, paired with positive behavioral interventions, problem-solving, conflict resolution, and resilience-building, rather than a standalone policy or peripheral reference.[4] A related term, ""restorative practices,"" emerges in a school improvement plan (SIP) for an alternative program, where professional learning communities focus on trauma-informed care and restorative practices for behavioral intervention and classroom management, indicating broader philosophical alignment with restorative approaches in student support.[6]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for Restorative Justice, such as specialized coordinators, facilitators, centers, or named programs like Restorative Justice Centers; it falls under general school psychological services with contact at 407.320.0216, and psychologists provide related supports like counseling, assessments, and crisis intervention.[4] Professional development on restorative practices is noted in alternative education contexts, including PLCs on trauma-informed care and intervention plans, but without specific training programs or organizational structures named.[6] Alternative placements like Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy emphasize life skills and mental health counseling but do not reference restorative methods.[1]

"**Restorative Justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within school psychological services and select alternative programs, though it is not presented as a district-wide mandate.**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears explicitly on the School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the goal of ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" alongside actions like implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, preventing bullying, and providing crisis intervention[3]. School psychologists are described as promoting this through positive discipline strategies that support social-emotional learning and school connectedness. Related term ""restorative practices"" emerges more prominently in school improvement plans, such as Journeys Academy's SIP, where the school is designated a **Restorative Practices school** that structures each day with restorative circles to foster community, empathy, and skills like patience and kindness; it also includes new **Restorative Coaching Sessions** requiring students to complete eight sessions focused on restoration and ""making things right,"" alongside small group counseling[1]. Another SIP for Endeavor references **restorative practices** in professional learning communities addressing trauma-informed care and behavioral interventions[6]. These mentions occur in official program descriptions and action plans rather than mission statements or staff listings, framing restorative approaches as tools for behavior management, mental health promotion, and reducing exclusionary discipline, such as in reset classrooms or addressing absenteeism among disadvantaged students[1].

This indicates restorative justice and practices form part of SCPS's philosophy for positive behavior and safe climates, integrated into psychological services and alternative education to shift discipline from punishment to community-focused learning and harm repair, as evidenced by fidelity checks, reflection logs, and stakeholder engagement in plans[1][3]. School psychologists conceptualize it as promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, resilience, and peer relationships, aligning with broader MTSS and SEL efforts[3]. However, it appears targeted rather than universally applied across all schools.

No dedicated infrastructure like restorative justice coordinators, centers, or district-wide training programs is detailed; instead, implementation relies on existing roles such as school psychologists, social workers, administrators (e.g., Greg Handy, Grace Russo), and mental health counselors within alternative settings like Journeys Academy[1][3]. Professional development is noted for restorative practices in specific PD initiatives and PLCs, but not as standalone programs[1][6].

It is framed as an active strategy within the broader duties of school psychologists, who partner with families, teachers, administrators, and community providers to foster supportive learning environments.

**Philosophy Assessment**: Restorative Justice aligns with SCPS's core philosophy of holistic student support, emphasizing mental health, positive behavior, and social-emotional learning rather than punitive measures. School psychologists conceptualize it as a tool to prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, and improve school connectedness, complementing efforts like promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, resilience, and positive peer relationships.[3] This integration reflects a district-wide commitment to proactive, relationship-based strategies, evident in psychological services that ""apply expertise in mental health, learning, and behavior"" to help students succeed across domains.[3] In alternative programs and SIPs, restorative practices extend this philosophy to at-risk youth, including those in juvenile justice transitions, framing them as part of building rapport, tracking behavior, and providing positive reinforcement.[5][6]

**Infrastructure**: No dedicated staff positions, such as restorative justice coordinators or specialists, are named; instead, implementation falls under **school psychologists** (contact: 407.320.0216), who deliver these services district-wide.[3] Programs incorporating restorative approaches include alternative education sites like **Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy/Consequence Unit**, **Seminole County Juvenile Detention Center**, and **John Polk Alternative School**, which provide life skills, mental health counseling, and behavioral supports for expelled or justice-involved students.[1][6] Professional development initiatives focus on restorative practices, trauma-informed care, and behavioral interventions, facilitated through professional learning communities (PLCs) and workshops, as seen in SIPs for schools like Endeavor and the Consequence Unit.[5][6] The **School Psychological Services** department and **Student Support Services** (encompassing intervention services, crisis management, and MTSS) provide the organizational structure, with ties to broader mental health efforts via school social workers and counselors.[3][4][7] Partnerships, such as the Seminole Resilient Community Project with the Peace and Justice Institute, indirectly bolster this through resiliency workshops and youth summits, though not explicitly restorative.[2]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), where it is presented as part of the official framework for creating safe, positive school climates[4]. Specifically, restorative justice is mentioned within the district's stated objectives to ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" as a key function of school psychological services[4]. This positioning indicates that restorative justice is not a peripheral mention but rather an established policy objective integrated into the district's formal approach to student support and school management.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative justice appears to be a foundational element of Seminole County Public Schools' educational philosophy, conceptualized as an alternative to traditional punitive discipline methods. The district frames restorative justice within a broader commitment to positive behavioral supports and mental health promotion. This philosophy is reinforced through the Positive Behavior Support: A Multi-Tiered Support System (PBS: MTSS), which the district describes as ""a positive and effective alternative to the traditional methods of discipline"" that is ""research-based and proven to significantly reduce the occurrence of problem behaviors in the school, resulting in a more positive school climate and increased academic performance""[5]. The district's approach emphasizes collaboration between families and professionals, alignment with federal special education law, and the reduction of suspensions and expulsions as disciplinary tools[5].

**Infrastructure**

The district has established substantial infrastructure to support restorative justice and related practices. School Psychological Services departments operate across the district with staff trained to implement these approaches[4]. The district has designated 20 schools as MODEL schools through the Positive Behavior Intervention Support program, indicating systematic implementation of restorative practices[5]. Additionally, the Consequence Alternative Sanctions Unit (CASU) and Project S.W.E.A.T. (Sheriff's Work Ethics and Training) program, operated through the Juvenile Justice Division in collaboration with the Sheriff's Office, provide restorative alternatives for youth violating probation or conditional release terms, emphasizing ""supervised, meaningful, labor-intensive, community service"" and restorative justice application[1]. The Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy serves as an alternative placement facility offering education, life skills development, and mental health services for students returning from residential commitment or facing expulsion[1][2]. Furthermore, the district's ""Seminole Resilient Community Project,"" funded by a $435,085 award, demonstrates institutional commitment to building restorative capacity through workshops and youth summits focused on resilience, leadership, and communication skills[3].

**Limitations**

The available content does not provide specific information about Chiles Middle School's individual implementation of restorative justice practices, staff dedicated to these efforts at the school level, or school-specific programs. The information reflects district-wide policies and infrastructure rather than school-specific details.

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Hagerty High School / Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice is part of Seminole County Public Schools' district-wide approach, though the available content does not contain school-specific information from Hagerty High School itself. The term appears exclusively in district-level documentation rather than on the school's individual website.

**Contextual Understanding**

The term ""restorative justice"" appears on the Seminole County Public Schools School Psychological Services webpage[4], which outlines the district's comprehensive student support framework. In this context, restorative justice is presented as one component of the district's broader commitment to creating safe and positive school climates. The reference appears within a section describing how school psychological services help schools ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates,"" where restorative justice is listed alongside related initiatives such as implementing school-wide positive behavioral supports, preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, and identifying at-risk students[4].

The district frames restorative justice as an approach to be ""implemented and promoted"" as part of its positive discipline strategy[4]. This positioning suggests that restorative justice is viewed as an official district policy or practice rather than an experimental or peripheral initiative.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Based on the available content, restorative justice appears to be integrated into Seminole County Public Schools' educational philosophy as part of a comprehensive, multi-layered approach to student discipline and school climate. The district conceptualizes restorative justice within a broader framework that emphasizes positive relationships, conflict resolution, and community building. However, the district-level documentation does not provide detailed explanation of how the district specifically defines or operationalizes restorative justice principles.

**Infrastructure**

The available content does not identify dedicated staff positions, specific programs, or organizational structures at Hagerty High School related to restorative justice. The district-level webpage references school psychological services, school social workers, and school counselors as part of the broader support infrastructure[4], but does not specify whether Hagerty High School has dedicated restorative justice coordinators, facilitators, or specialized programs. No training initiatives, restorative justice centers, or alternative programs specific to Hagerty High School are mentioned in the provided content.

"Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' approach, as stated in the district's description of School Psychological Services, where school psychologists are tasked with helping schools ""implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" alongside efforts to create safe, positive school climates, prevent bullying, support social-emotional learning, and implement school-wide positive behavioral supports.[3] The term appears solely on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), within a bulleted list under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section, positioning it as one component of broader school psychologist responsibilities that also include assessing school climate, identifying at-risk students, and providing crisis intervention; it is not framed as a standalone policy, mission statement, or staff listing but as an integrated practice within mental health and behavioral support strategies.[3]

This mention suggests Restorative Justice is incorporated into the district's educational philosophy as a tool for fostering positive discipline and school connectedness, aligning with related emphases on promoting problem-solving, conflict resolution, positive peer relationships, and positive behavioral interventions across services like Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS), which provides research-based alternatives to traditional discipline to reduce problem behaviors and suspensions.[3][4] However, the content does not elaborate on how the district conceptualizes Restorative Justice specifically—whether as formal circles, mediation, or community accountability—treating it instead as part of a holistic approach to mental health, behavior management, and safe environments led by school psychologists who partner with families, teachers, and administrators.[3] Peripheral references in school improvement plans (SIPs) for specific schools reinforce this philosophy through professional development on ""**restorative practices**,"" trauma-informed care, and behavioral interventions, indicating district-wide integration into staff training and intervention plans, though not uniquely tied to Elevation High School.[6][7]

No dedicated infrastructure for Restorative Justice is evident in the content, such as specialized staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), named programs (e.g., Restorative Justice Centers), or distinct training initiatives; instead, it falls under the purview of existing school psychologists, who provide counseling, assessments, and school-wide supports, with related structures like PBS: MTSS training for all district school staff and alternative programs for at-risk or juvenile justice-involved students.[3][4][9] School social workers and mental health counselors contribute to aligned efforts in behavior and social skills, but without explicit Restorative Justice roles.[5][8] External judicial programs mention ""Community Restorative Justice"" as a sanction (e.g., hours for missed attendance), but these are not district-operated.[2]

"# Restorative Justice Approach: Seminole County Public Schools

**Restorative Justice Presence**

Restorative justice and restorative practices are clearly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) disciplinary and school climate approach. The district has formally integrated these practices into its official policies, strategic plans, and school improvement initiatives across multiple schools within the district.

**Contextual Understanding**

References to restorative justice and restorative practices appear throughout SCPS documentation, including district-level policy pages and individual school improvement plans. On the district's School Psychological Services page, restorative justice is listed as a core component of the district's approach to creating safe, positive school climates[5]. The term appears in the context of official district initiatives rather than as a passing reference, positioned alongside other evidence-based practices such as positive behavioral supports and social-emotional learning.

At the school level, multiple School Improvement Plans (SIPs) from 2023-2024 document the implementation of restorative practices. For example, one school's SIP explicitly states that ""the faculty and staff will be trained on the implementation of restorative practice in order to continue to foster positive"" school environments[7]. Another school's improvement plan details specific strategies to ""use restorative practices with students in conflict"" as part of a broader effort to reduce discipline incidents[8]. These references appear within formal action plans and strategic initiatives rather than peripheral mentions.

**Philosophy Assessment**

Restorative practices are integrated into SCPS's educational philosophy as a foundational approach to discipline and community building. The district conceptualizes restorative justice as a method for developing community, managing conflict, and repairing harm while restoring relationships[1]. This philosophy emphasizes giving students a voice through circles and conferencing, positioning restorative practices as an alternative to purely punitive discipline models.

The district's approach extends beyond discipline to encompass broader school climate improvement. Restorative practices are paired with trauma-informed care in professional development initiatives, suggesting the district views these practices as part of a comprehensive approach to student and staff wellbeing[2]. Preliminary data from 2023 showed improvements in all five areas of the ""5 Essentials Culture and Climate Survey"" (Student Safety, Teacher Safety, Supportive Learning Environment, Student-Teacher Trust, and Connectivity) in schools that implemented the restorative and trauma-informed care model[2].

**Infrastructure**

SCPS has established formal infrastructure to support restorative practices implementation. The district employs school psychologists and school social workers who support the implementation of these practices[5]. Individual schools have designated staff responsible for restorative practice implementation; for example, specific administrators are tasked with conducting classroom walkthroughs and interviewing students to ensure restorative practices are occurring with fidelity[1].

Professional development represents a key component of the infrastructure. Schools conduct ongoing training for faculty and staff on restorative practice implementation, with some schools scheduling initial training at the beginning of the school year followed by ongoing professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care and restorative practices[6]. The district also implements Multi-Tiered Systems of Support (MTSS) teams that link students struggling with social-emotional development to intervention programs, including those utilizing restorative approaches[1].

Additionally, SCPS has integrated restorative practices into teacher education partnerships, with universities infusing these practices into elementary education programs in collaboration with the district[2]. The district tracks implementation through documentation systems such as EdInsight, where teachers record check-ins and restorative practice activities[1].

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, as school psychologists are tasked with implementing and promoting it alongside positive discipline to create safe, positive school climates.[3] Related terms like **restorative practices** appear in school improvement plans, such as at Endeavor, where they are integrated into school-wide emotional and behavioral strategies and professional learning communities focused on trauma-informed care.[6]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears specifically on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4 and https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section as a key responsibility: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and **restorative justice**"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports.""[3] It is framed as part of school psychologists' role in preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, assessing school climate, identifying at-risk students, and providing crisis intervention, rather than as a standalone policy, program description, or mission statement. ""Restorative practices"" is mentioned in a school-specific improvement plan PDF (likely from an alternative program like Endeavor), under goals for professional development on behavioral intervention, trauma-informed care, and intervention plan effectiveness.[6]

This approach aligns with SCPS's broader philosophy of promoting positive behavior and mental health, where **restorative justice** is conceptualized as a proactive, school-wide strategy to foster connectedness, reduce violence, and support emotional needs, integrated with **Positive Behavior Support (PBS: MTSS)**—a research-based, multi-tiered system that reduces problem behaviors and suspensions as an alternative to traditional discipline.[3][4] It is not peripheral but embedded in the district's mental health and student support framework, partnering school psychologists with counselors, social workers, families, and administrators to reinforce skills like problem-solving, conflict resolution, peer relationships, and resilience.[3][5][7]

No dedicated infrastructure is evident for Restorative Justice, such as specialized coordinators, facilitators, centers, or named programs; instead, it falls under existing roles like **school psychologists** (contact: 407.320.0216), who consult on school-wide practices, and general professional development initiatives.[3][6] Related supports include **PBS: MTSS** with 20 model schools district-wide, school social workers for truancy and counseling, and alternative placements like Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy, though these emphasize life skills and mental health without direct restorative links.[1][4][5] Training occurs via professional learning communities and staff-wide PBS implementation, but specifics for restorative justice are not detailed.[4][6]

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is explicitly part of Seminole County Public Schools' (SCPS) approach, particularly within the framework of school psychological services, where it is promoted alongside positive discipline and school-wide positive behavioral supports to create safe, positive school climates.[4]

The term ""restorative justice"" appears solely on the district's School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), listed under the ""Create Safe, Positive School Climates"" section as one of several strategies: ""Implement and promote positive discipline and restorative justice"" and ""Implement school-wide positive behavioral supports.""[4] It is not mentioned on the Galileo School for Gifted Learning Skyway school website or in broader program descriptions, mission statements, or staff listings; instead, it emerges as a targeted component of psychological services aimed at preventing bullying, supporting social-emotional learning, assessing school climate, and providing crisis intervention.[4] Related concepts appear peripherally elsewhere, such as ""Restorative Practices"" in a school improvement plan (SIP) for an alternative program like Endeavor, which integrates them into school-wide emotional and behavioral strategies, professional development on trauma-informed care, and professional learning communities (PLCs).[6]

Restorative Justice aligns with SCPS's overarching philosophy of fostering positive behavior, mental health, and safe learning environments through school psychologists' expertise in mental health, learning, and behavior.[4] It is conceptualized as an integrated practice for improving school connectedness, managing behavior, and promoting resilience, rather than a peripheral mention—paired directly with evidence-based approaches like positive behavioral supports and conflict resolution.[4] This reflects a district-wide commitment to proactive, supportive interventions that strengthen home-school-community ties, as school psychologists collaborate with administrators to enhance school-wide policies.[4] In the Endeavor SIP, restorative practices are embedded in behavioral interventions, rapport-building, and ongoing professional development, indicating philosophical integration into student support systems for at-risk youth.[6]

No dedicated infrastructure, such as specific coordinators, facilitators, restorative justice centers, or named training programs, is detailed for Restorative Justice; it is instead supported through existing roles like school psychologists, who implement and promote it as part of their multifaceted duties.[4] Broader mental health infrastructure includes school social workers, counselors, and tiered supports, with professional development on related topics like restorative practices and trauma-informed care occurring via PLCs and PD sessions in programs like Endeavor.[6][7] Alternative programs (e.g., Eugene Gregory Memorial Youth Academy, John Polk Alternative School) emphasize life skills and counseling but do not reference restorative approaches.[1][8] Overall, implementation relies on psychological services and general staff training rather than specialized structures.

"**Restorative Justice Presence**: Restorative Justice is not part of the Seminole County Detention Center's approach, as the term appears only as an isolated keyword match on a single page of the Seminole County Public Schools website without any substantive description, implementation details, or integration into school practices.[1]

The term ""restorative justice"" was flagged solely on the School Psychological Services page (https://www.scps.k12.fl.us/30091_4), which outlines the roles and services of school psychologists in supporting student mental health, behavior, and learning. This page details interventions like promoting positive behavior through communication skills, counseling, problem-solving, anger management, conflict resolution, positive coping skills, resilience, peer relationships, and social problem-solving, but the term itself does not appear in the visible scraped content. It functions as a passing keyword reference rather than part of official policies, program descriptions, staff listings, or mission statements, with no examples of its application in the detention center context.

This peripheral mention does not indicate Restorative Justice as part of the school's philosophy or integrated educational approach; the content conceptualizes school psychologist services around psychological assessments, behavior management, mental health promotion, and diverse learner support without linking to restorative principles like victim-offender mediation or community accountability. No evidence suggests the school/district views it as a core strategy.

No infrastructure supports Restorative Justice, including dedicated staff positions, programs, training initiatives, or organizational structures; the content lacks any such references, focusing instead on general psychological and behavioral supports.

"**Restorative practices, a key component of restorative justice, form an intentional part of The Chiles Academy's approach to community building, conflict resolution, and student support.** The terms ""restorative justice"" and ""restorative practices"" appear prominently on the school's website, particularly on dedicated pages like https://www.thechilesacademy.com/restorative-practices and https://www.thechilesacademy.com/our-vision, as well as in navigation menus across 26 pages including board-of-directors, academic, community-resources, and news[1][4]. These mentions are not passing references but integrated into program descriptions and philosophy statements; for instance, the restorative practices page details the introduction of ""restorative circle practice"" into the parenting curriculum in Fall 2020 to foster sharing and connection amid pandemic challenges, while the vision page describes implementing ""sharing circles"" over the last three years with positive student feedback shaping broader community applications[1][4].

This integration reflects a core philosophical commitment, positioning restorative practices as tools for empowerment within the school's mission to support pregnant and parenting students toward high school diplomas and responsible citizenship. The academy conceptualizes them as proactive and reactive strategies: sharing circles enhance parenting classes (e.g., Child Development, Family Dynamics), Community Norms set behavioral baselines addressed monthly at Community Meetings, and an adapted **Restorative Justice Conferencing model** directly influences discipline procedures, reducing frequency and improving outcomes[1]. These elements align with the school's emphasis on problem-solving, emotional communication, and addressing trauma—evident in recommended resources like Brummer's *Building a Trauma-Informed Restorative School* and Van der Kolk's *The Body Keeps the Score*—to help students navigate abuse, housing insecurity, and high infant mortality risks in their community[1][4].

While no dedicated staff positions (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), standalone centers, or formal training programs are explicitly named, the practices are embedded in curriculum delivery by faculty and staff, with ongoing adaptations based on student input indicating schoolwide infrastructure through existing structures like parenting classes and community meetings[1][4]. The student handbook references adherence to Volusia County Code of Student Conduct with zero tolerance for violence but does not detail restorative integration, suggesting it complements rather than replaces punitive measures[3].

"**Restorative Justice is not part of the documented approach of Florida Scholars Academy / DJJ District.** Analysis of the provided content from 65 pages on the DJJ district website reveals that terms like **restorative justice**, **restorative practices**, and **race equity** appear repeatedly across DJJ weekly letters and press releases spanning 2009 to 2020, but solely as isolated keywords without accompanying explanations, implementations, or contextual details.[1][2][3] For instance, ""restorative justice"" is flagged on pages such as the November 14, 2019 DJJ Weekly Letter, a 2010 press release on juvenile justice reform bills passing House committees, and multiple 2018-2019 weekly letters (e.g., December 4, 2018; November 21, 2019), yet the scraped excerpts show no substantive discussion—only standard DJJ navigation menus referencing general resources like trauma-informed care, risk assessment, and the Office of Fidelity, Accountability, and Support (OFAS), which promotes research-informed practices without linking to restorative methods.[1][4][5]

These mentions occur peripherally in news archives, not within official policies, program descriptions, mission statements, staff listings, or educational frameworks specific to Florida Scholars Academy. No examples integrate the terms into juvenile justice processes, such as pre-arrest delinquency citations or residential programs, nor do they appear on the Florida Scholars Academy school website, which emphasizes flexible virtual education, credit recovery, CTE certifications, and high school diplomas for DJJ residential students without referencing restorative approaches.[6] This suggests the terms are passing references, possibly in lists of broader initiatives like disproportionate minority contact forums (2009 press releases) or reform legislation, but lack any narrative tying them to DJJ's operational philosophy.

Restorative justice does not appear integrated into the district's or school's philosophy, which centers on accountability, evidence-based programming via OFAS, data integrity in the Juvenile Justice Information System (JJIS), and public safety commitments, as seen in 2020 press releases and weekly letters.[7] No conceptualization is provided—no definitions, goals, or connections to youth outcomes—and the terms are not framed as core to education or rehabilitation in DJJ facilities served by Florida Scholars Academy.

No infrastructure supports restorative justice: the content identifies zero dedicated staff (e.g., coordinators or facilitators), programs (e.g., restorative centers), training initiatives, or organizational structures. References to related efforts, like OFAS (established 2006 for research-informed practices) or monitoring bureaus, do not mention restorative elements. Based on the available content, it is not possible to determine a meaningful approach, as terms are decontextualized flags without evidence of adoption or practice.
